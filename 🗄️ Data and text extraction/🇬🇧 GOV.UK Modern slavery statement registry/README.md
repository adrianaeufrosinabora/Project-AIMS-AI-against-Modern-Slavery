Therefore, [this notebook](https://github.com/the-future-society/Project-AIMS-AI-against-Modern-Slavery/blob/main/%F0%9F%97%84%EF%B8%8F%20Data%20and%20text%20extraction/%F0%9F%87%AC%F0%9F%87%A7%20GOV.UK%20Modern%20slavery%20statement%20registry/GOV.UK%20Modern%20slavery%20statement%20registry.ipynb) is proposing a simple, open solution to extracting the text from PDFs and HTMLs. 

## The steps are as follows:
- Accesses and downloads the latest version of the .CSV, by accessing  â€˜Modern slavery statement summaries (202x)â€™ from the  GOV.UK Modern slavery statement registry [page](https://modern-slavery-statement-registry.service.gov.uk/download)
- Once the data is downloaded, access the StatementURL column 
- For each document, access the fetch the PDF or HTML
- Once you have the PDFs and HTMLs, extract the text with the best tool you can find, and append the text as a column to the dataset
- Save the dataset

### A proposed version of [this workflow](https://github.com/the-future-society/Project-AIMS-AI-against-Modern-Slavery/blob/main/%F0%9F%97%84%EF%B8%8F%20Data%20and%20text%20extraction/WikiRate/WikiRate_labeled_data.ipynb) is attached to this directory. A version of the data as available in November 2021 will be available soon.
