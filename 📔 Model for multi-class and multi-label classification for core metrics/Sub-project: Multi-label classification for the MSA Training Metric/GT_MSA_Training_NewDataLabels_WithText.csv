Slavery and human trafficking statement 2016
This statement relates to Serco Group plc, covering all business regions, operating companies and business
units throughout the world, including wholly owned subsidiaries and majority-owned operations.
The statement relates to our financial year 2016.

Introduction
Serco is clear about the ethics and business standards that it operates to which recognises its obligations
under the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015. These standards are defined in the Serco Management System
(SMS) – the policy framework the company operates within, and our Code of Conduct. This includes
respecting the human rights of individuals wherever it operates and not engaging in any form of human
trafficking or use forced, compulsory, illegal or child labour, or knowingly work with anyone who does.

Our business
Serco is a leading provider of public services with over 50,000 employees and turnover in 2016 of £3,047m.
Serco’s customers are governments or others operating in the public sector. Serco gains scale, expertise and
diversification by operating internationally across five sectors and four geographies: Defence, Justice &
Immigration, Transport, Health and Citizen Services, delivered in UK & Europe, North America, Asia Pacific

Our structure and business model
Serco’s business operates through a number of divisions each under the direction of a Divisional Chief
Executive and Executive Management Team. The Divisional Chief Executives, along with other senior leaders
responsible for corporate functions and the Executive Directors from the plc Board, form the Executive
Committee of the company. This Committee reports through the Executive Directors to the Serco Group plc
Board.
The plc Board has ultimate responsibility for and sets human rights policy, including that relating to slavery
and human trafficking, which sits within the SMS.
Serco’s business model starts with the identification of a pipeline of contract opportunities. These identified
opportunities go through a series of ‘gate’ approvals which consider the risk profile of each potential contract,
including human rights impacts. Serco’s services are ordinarily delivered through a commitment to a longterm contract with the customer. Risks, including potential human rights, slavery and human trafficking
impacts, are monitored and managed through the contracts lifecycle.

Our supply chain
The relationship between Serco and its suppliers is an important component in achieving high performance in
our business. In selecting suppliers, Serco works hard to choose reputable business partners who are
committed to ethical standards and business practices compatible with those of Serco. Whilst Serco operates
in a number of different markets, its operations are characterised by the provision of services. This is
reflected in the make-up of its supply chain which is summarised below.

Our governance
The SMS defines the rules which govern the way Serco operates. One of the policy areas covered is Business
Conduct and Ethics, including Serco’s commitments regarding human rights, slavery and human trafficking.
Full details on the SMS are available on our website at www.serco.com/sms.
The Corporate Responsibility Committee, a formal committee of the plc Board, provides oversight in regard to
the implementation of human rights policy and the monitoring of risks and issues raised through Serco’s
Speak Up process. Policy implementation is through the Executive Committee, Divisional Chief Executives and
their Executive Management Teams.
Relevant policies and standards relating to slavery and human trafficking include:
• Our Code of Conduct
• Business Conduct and Ethics policy statement
• Human Rights Group Standard
• People policy statement
• Employee Lifecycle Group Standard
• Procurement and Supply Chain Group Standard
• Our Supplier Code of Conduct
• Speak Up Group Standard
These are available on our website at www.serco.com/about.

Our Code of Conduct
Supporting the SMS is Serco’s Code of Conduct (www.serco.com/code). Serco’s Code defines what the
company is committed to do and the standards it expects. Serco’s Values – Trust, Care, Innovation, Pride –
define the behaviours it expects. While the Code of Conduct defines ‘what’ is expected, the Values define the
‘how’, and with this the behaviours that are expected from those who work for us.
The employee Code of Conduct is supported by our ‘Supplier Code of Conduct’, which applies to all Serco’s
suppliers, their facilities and the suppliers they work with in providing goods and services to Serco. It
formalises Serco's practices and, recognising differences in cultures and legal requirements, makes clear the
expectation that wherever our suppliers are located, whether producing products for us or delivering services
for us, they operate in a manner compatible with the high standards that contribute to the reputation of
Serco.
Slavery and human trafficking are specifically covered in both Serco’s Code of Conduct and its Supplier Code
of Conduct. Both these documents explain how to raise issues through Serco’s Speak Up process, including
concerns regarding slavery and human trafficking. This service is provided by an independent third party.
The management and investigation of concerns raised is governed by procedures embedded in the SMS. The
Executive Committee and Corporate Responsibility Committee receive reports on Speak Up activity,
investigations and actions taken. During 2016 there were no issues relating to slavery and human trafficking
raised.

Our risks and due diligence
Serco recognises its responsibility to understand the human rights risks, including those relating to slavery
and human trafficking, and any potential impacts associated with the services we provide, the customers we
work with, the suppliers we use, and through the fair and appropriate treatment of our employees and those
who are in the facilities we manage or benefit from the services we provide.
Serco uses a Human Rights assessment and decision tree process as a tool for evaluating any adverse human
rights impacts caused or contributed to by our operations, and impacts directly linked to our operations
through our business partners and related third parties. Human rights impacts are assessed for existing

2016 slavery and human trafficking statement for Serco Group plc - 3 of 5 - Serco Public

Slavery and human trafficking statement
2016
business operations and markets; along with appropriate due diligence, for new markets, geographies,
acquisitions, bids and rebid opportunities; and for business partners and related third parties when acting in
connection with Serco’s own operations.
Serco considers risks to people as being risks to its business. This enables Serco to understand its
responsibilities, respond to situations where rights are impacted and respond to opportunities. When
identifying potential adverse impacts, consideration is given to engaging relevant stakeholders to identify how
business activities can cause, contribute to or be directly linked with adverse impacts. Such engagement is
also considered when developing effective mitigation and / or planning for remediation. If a risk is identified
it is reviewed by the Divisional Executive Management Team and, if significant, the issue is raised to the
Executive Committee, and in extreme cases considered by the plc Board.
Serco’s current assessment is of a low risk of slavery and human trafficking taking place in our direct business
operations. One area we have focused on is the use of out-of-country employment agencies, particularly
those based in high risk countries. For example, our business in the Middle East use a number of out of
country recruitment agencies. These have been subject to due diligence; are not allowed to charge
candidates, which is embedded in the contracts they sign; and are paid a fair rate for the service they
provide. These controls are supplemented with a candidate satisfaction survey undertaken by a randomly
selected group of new employees to ensure there are no issues which might lead to any form of slavery,
bonded or forced labour.
We recognise the potential risk that those who are in the facilities we manage or benefit from the services we
provide may have been subject to slavery or human trafficking, particularly in regard to immigration
operations. In the UK, Serco have trained immigration and related staff to recognise potential red flags and
raise concerns should they believe that someone has been subject to slavery or human trafficking. In 2017,
this will be reviewed and the potential to extend it to operations in AsPac considered.
In Serco Americas, a programme of activity to address the findings of the US Trafficking in Persons Report
was aligned with the UK Modern Slavery Act in the development of procedures and training focused on the
prevention of human trafficking, which will be implemented across the Division.
In AsPac, approximately 40 compliance reviews with varying scopes were completed in 2016. No issues
relating to human rights, slavery or forced labour were found.
Serco Middle East have introduced a questionnaire that all new suppliers are required to complete, which
includes declarations of compliance with the Modern Slavery Act. In addition, the Serco Group Suppliers Code
of Conduct is issued to all new suppliers with requirement to confirm receipt, understanding and compliance.
Serco undertakes due diligence of its tier 1 suppliers. In 2016, Serco enhanced its due diligence process,
which includes monitoring for human trafficking / human rights / slavery / exploitation violations or any
adverse media in these areas. For suppliers in high risk areas or where a potential issue has been raised,
Serco undertakes enhanced due diligence.
In 2017, Serco will look to further strengthen its supplier due diligence process in specific risk areas to seek
greater assurance from those selected tier 1 suppliers in regards to their commitment to ensuring slavery and
human trafficking is not within their supply chain.

Training
Serco employees receive training on Serco’s Code of Conduct as part of their induction and on annual basis,
as part of mandated ‘Serco Essentials’ training. In recognised high risk areas, specific training on slavery and
human trafficking is undertaken, as mentioned above.

Slavery and human trafficking statement
2016
Serco recognises that improved awareness supports reducing the risk of modern slavery. In 2017, Serco will
review how slavery and human trafficking risks and awareness might be better incorporated within training
generally and to specific groups of employees.

Monitoring
Serco uses a number of indicators to monitor how it manages and communicates its policy and potential
impacts as well as specific concerns regarding modern slavery. Indicators used include the proportion of
suppliers evaluated through its due diligence process; numbers of employees trained on Serco’s Code of
Conduct; and numbers of issues raised through Serco’s Speak Up process. These are covered in the quarterly
reporting process to the Executive Committee and also the Corporate Responsibility Committee. These key
performance indicators will be subject to ongoing review by the Corporate Responsibility Committee on behalf
of the plc Board, to ensure their continued effectiveness.

Our Commitment
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes Serco’s
slavery and human trafficking statement as agreed by senior management and the Board.

Modern Slavery Statements

“Slavery is illegal at all times and in all places. It is officially banned from our
economic system. Yet while states have formally abolished slavery, informally
economic systems continue to tolerate and generate practices that generate similar
results. Although slavery is illegal, there are currently an estimated 40.3 million
people in modern slavery or victims of human trafficking. That is around 1 in every
185 people alive.”
- A Blueprint for Mobilizing Finance Against Slavery and Trafficking,
September 2019

1 in 4 victims are children.
- A Blueprint for Mobilizing Finance Against Slavery and Trafficking
September 2019

An estimated 40.3 MILLION people are victims of modern slavery or
human trafficking.
‘Modern Slavery’ is the phrase used to describe the crimes of human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like
practices such as servitude, forced labour, forced or servile marriage, the sale and exploitation of children,
and debt bondage. A common thread runs through all of these offences: they involve one person depriving
another person of their liberty, in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain.
This, our fourth Modern Slavery Statement has been published in accordance with the UK Modern Slavery
Act (2015). Section 54
of the MSA requires every organisation with a global annual turnover of £36 million or more, which carries
out business (or part of a business) in the UK, to produce a slavery and human trafficking statement for
each financial year. The statement should set out
the steps a business has taken that year to identify and eradicate modern slavery from its business and its
supply chain. Lush’s financial year runs from July to the end of June.
In addition to the UK Modern Slavery Act, similar legislation has been introduced in other parts of the
world (the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (2010), French Duty of Vigilance Law (2017) and
Australian Modern Slavery Bill (2018)) which is an important step in widening the reach and discussions
around this important topic.

Publishing a Modern Slavery Statement is a step towards transparency with customers and a businesses
wider stakeholder community and can encourage change.
This statement details what Lush is doing to combat the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in
our own business and in our supply chains provides an update on the activities and commitments detailed
in our previous (third) Modern Slavery Statement and the steps taken during the period covered by the last
statement (our financial year July 2018 - June 2019). The statement also outlines
our commitments towards mitigating the risk of modern slavery in our supply chain going forward.

Our Business - Organisational Structure

Lush is a UK cosmetics brand, with its head office in Poole and an additional office in London. Lush was
started in 1995 by a close-knit team who have continued to work together for over 40 years (2020 marks
Lush’s 25th anniversary).
The first Lush shop opened at 29 High St, Poole in April 1995, with products being made in
a small space above the shop. Lush places emphasis on the benefits of using the finest quality fresh,
natural ingredients in our products for their nutritious effects on the body and mind. We strive to ensure
our products reach our customers in the freshest condition, when they are most potent and effective – it’s
at the heart
of our philosophy. We use ingredients such as fruits and vegetables, herbs, flowers, butters and essential
oils - organic wherever possible - and with minimal synthetic preservatives.
All products are vegetarian, and the majority are vegan too.
Lush’s global expansion whilst rapid has been carefully controlled. 24 years on Lush has over 100 stores
in the UK, 900+ shops worldwide
and is present in 50 countries, with manufacturing operations in 6 countries, employing over 18,000
people. We have also opened Lush Spas in
select locations across the UK, France, Korea, Japan and Hong Kong and have more planned. We invent,
manufacture and retail our own range of unique products so that we can be confident that our beliefs and
ethics are carried through at all stages.
We are very proud to offer a range of fresh, handmade, cosmetic products which are all manufactured in
house at our six manufacturing sites based in the UK, Germany, Croatia, Japan, Australia and North
America and sold through our retail shops and digital channels.
At the time of writing this statement, a total of 1220 product lines are made (including gift sizes) at our
manufacturing sites.

The Lush business is run in accordance with
a set of founding ethical principles written by
our founders at the very beginning of Lush’s life, commonly known as our ‘We Believe Statement’. These
principles underpin all that we do and run through every vein of our business.

Our Business - Our Supply Chains

Lush products are for sale in our shops and our website invented in-house and manufactured by our own
factories. The Creative Buying Team manages the supply chains and together with the Ethical Compliance
Team, who are part of this team, ensure product and raw material suppliers are selected based on ethical
and sustainable as well as commercial criteria.
Product supply chains are complex, involving
a number of different processes - Lush’s supply chains are no exception, although we try wherever
possible to buy as direct as we can most supply chains are made up of several tiers stretching over
numerous countries.
We source materials from 93 countries globally.

We have many supply chains that contribute
to the operation of our business and as the
Lush business continues to grow in size, so do our supply chains. For example, our raw material supply
chains are made up of a network of approximately 340 suppliers all over the world. This number continues
to evolve as we discover new materials, meet new suppliers and source materials to meet the growing
business needs.
We are committed to sourcing and developing top quality, ethical materials for our products through a
resilient global network.

We also grow materials ourselves via agricultural projects and direct partnerships around the world. From
the early days of buying, we learned the hard way, from the adulteration of our essential oils, that it is vital
to gain an understanding of each material, the local impacts of its production and who is involved in its
supply chain in order to ensure top quality ingredients with no exploitation at any of its stages. As a
business, we realised that we could have both a positive and negative impact through our business
operations. Since then, we have aspired to maximise the benefit of our actions, relying on positive and
open relationships with our suppliers and producers to find a path to a truly ethical and sustainable
business that will last into the future.
Our vision is that each and every ingredient we purchase is helping contribute to a positive future. We are
already building a web of like-minded pioneers who wish to become part of the answer to the problems
we all see every day. Through the ingredients we buy and through the people we meet and partner with,
we are finding that some of these answers come through reciprocal trade. That means finding ways in
which we can grow, produce, manufacture and ship our goods that are truly sustainable.
In fact, we have ceased to aim for just sustainable but wish to reach beyond that to regenerative - making
sure that our purchases put back more into the soil, to the community and the natural world than they take
out and at the same time provide profit and a viable business for all of us.
The risk of modern slavery lies in all tiers of a company's supply chain. For Lush one of these high-risk
supply chains was mica which is why we have moved away from sourcing natural
mica and why we made the decision to go completely natural mica-free as of the 1st January 2018.
Another high-risk industry is mining. We are currently in the process of putting together an internal policy
on purchasing practices around mined materials. Our focus on the palm industry began many years ago
as we realised the destructive practices involved but we also now regard it as a high slavery risk. So Lush
is currently in the process of identifying and eradicating the last remnants of palm from our supply chain.

“Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and unions report that even
plantations that have been certified a ‘sustainable’ often show signs of
child labour and forced labour”
- Greenpeace, Final Countdown Report, 2018

Our policies and practices in relation to slavery and human trafficking Minimum requirements
We have several policies in place that help us to enforce the standards set to prevent the risk of Modern
Slavery in our supply chains and also encourage disclosure of any such practices within our business and
throughout our supply chains. These policies are reviewed, sent out and acknowledged by new and
existing suppliers annually.
As a minimum requirement all our suppliers need to comply and acknowledge the following policies /
documents (in addition to our strict Non-Animal Testing Policy and declaration)

Our Anti-Slavery & Human Trafficking Policy
This policy clearly defines Lush’s position on Modern Slavery and sets the minimum standards that we
expect all of our suppliers to comply with to ensure the fair treatment and well-being of all workers in our
supply chains. Any employee who breaches this policy will face disciplinary action, which could result in
dismissal
for misconduct or gross misconduct. We may terminate our relationship with other individuals and
organisations working on our behalf if they breach this policy.

Our People Care, Earth Care and Fair Share Buying Policy
These buying policies consist of legal requirements, non-negotiable standards and progressive standards.
The policies help us to ensure that our supply chain matches our core values which include the AntiSlavery & Human Trafficking policy.

Our Buying Policy Supplier Survey
The purpose of this online survey is to open a dialogue and to gather the information that will help Lush
identify positive practices in our supply chains or focus on what support might be needed to bring about
improvements. This is sent out annually for all direct suppliers to complete.

Our Whistleblowing Policy
Encourages our employees and anyone in our supply chains to report concerns of illegal or unethical
malpractice within our business or supply chains. The anonymity
of whistle-blowers and anyone raising concerns or bringing to our attention
practices that do not comply with our policies is protected. Our central whistleblowing email address
‘blowthewhistle@lush.co.uk’ is monitored by our Lush UK People Experience Team and whistleblowing
cases will be investigated and resolved in the shortest time possible.

Breaches to these policies are not taken lightly. Where there is opportunity to influence change we will
work hard with our suppliers to do so, but we will not hesitate to cease trade with any organisation where
breaches of our policies are severe. The additional information from our Buying Policy Supplier Survey
enables us to benchmark suppliers and practices to keep tracking progress against each of the areas
covered by our buying policy.

Taking responsibility - Governance
The Lush board of directors have overall responsibility for ensuring Lush’s compliance with the Modern
Slavery Act and that all those under our control comply with it. Management at all levels is responsible for
ensuring those reporting to them understand the issue of modern slavery and comply with this policy.
Our training is rolled out to key management within property, recruitment, buying, travel, imports, digital,
IT, and design.

Training and Raising Awareness
Over 18.000 people work for Lush globally - even more around peak times like Christmas when we recruit
seasonal staff. We want all employees to have an active and engaged understanding of the risks of
modern slavery to our business.
In November 2018, we have started to roll out training to the management of key teams within the
business to educate them on these risks
and indicators of modern slavery. These teams included Property, Recruitment (Head Office &
Manufacturing), Buying (Raw Mats & Packaging), Travel, Imports, Digital, IT and Design and we
aim to roll out this training to new areas of the business over the next year. With this experience, our staff
are more likely to identify possible warning signs and raise issues if a supplier
looks like they might be slipping below our expected standards.
Our Anti-slavery and Human Trafficking policy and Modern Slavery statements are published on our
website where staff, suppliers, customers and anyone with an interest can read about the risks to our
business and the steps we are taking to combat modern slavery.
During our reporting period 2019/20 we will roll out updated training for our buying team and online
training for all managers of all key departments. Relevant members of the Ethical Compliance team will
attend the latest Stronger Together Modern Slavery training sessions & work on an improved training
session that can be given to internal Lush teams and rolled out accross the business. We’ll also be
exploring options for supplier training.

Key performance indicators to measure the effectiveness of steps
taken in 2018/19 & what
Lush wants to achieve during 2019/20. Due diligence processes / Risk
assessment and management
We use key performance indicators to measure how effective we’ve been in combating slavery and human
trafficking in our business and supply chains.

These are the KPI’s Lush set for this year (reporting period 2018/19) to measure our success in
combating modern slavery:

• Number of suppliers visited and audited by our Buying Team • Number of suppliers audited by a third
party
• Number of slavery reports received
• Level and depth of Internal and External training
• Number of suppliers that completed our buying questionnaire
• Number of development targets met by suppliers to help improve working conditions
• Identifying high risk countries and industries for Modern Slavery
This year (2018/19), we have been focusing on strengthening our internal processes in order to be able to
monitor and address modern slavery risk as best as we can. Early 2018 saw the introduction of the Lush
People Care, Earth Care and Fair Share policy, with the People Care section being based on the Ethical
Trading Initiative Base Code and International Labour Organisation’s Fundamental Conventions. It defines
the minimum standards we require from our suppliers. The policy includes a prohibition of forced, bonded
or involuntary labour and also covers these areas:
• Employment freely chosen
• Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining
• Safe & hygienic working conditions
• Child labour
• Legal minimum wages and legally mandated benefits
• Working hours
• Discrimination
• Regular employment
• Harsh or inhumane treatment
• Homeworking & subcontracting
• Use of Genetically Modified Organisms
• Environment and biodiversity
• Chemical management practices
• Animal Welfare in Agriculture
• Soil Health
• Highly Hazardous Pesticides
• Forestry Management
• Fair Share
• Legal Obligations

We embarked on a trial with this brand new policy document in 2018 to gather feedback from suppliers
and also sent out an online supplier survey.
The buying policy was circulated to all Lush raw material and packaging suppliers in May 2018.
The online buying survey was circulated to all raw material and packaging suppliers in August 2018. Of the
top 50 suppliers, by spend, 97% completed the policy declaration and online survey.
We have since refined the Buying Policy and it has now been adopted as an official Lush policy (in
October 2019) and we are going to roll this out to our global markets in 2019/20.
The online supplier survey covered all areas of the Lush People Care, Earth Care and Fair Share policy.
From this we have created a dashboard that can easily be used by buying team to establish how suppliers
are doing in each policy section. This has been very useful as it made a significant amount of data usable
and enabled the buying team to have better conversations with suppliers around these topics. We have
however realised that this dashboard is not enough. We identified the need to have more live data and risk
data identified by country and industry.

We embarked on a journey of speaking with providers of supply chain risk management and transparency
platforms and after benchmarking several providers we made a decision to use SupplyShift. The purchase
of this software/platform was signed off by the business in May 2019.
Supplyshift is a technology solution that helps to automate a number of ethical sourcing practices across a
global supply chain. It covers supply chain mapping, supplier benchmarking, risk analysis, reporting and
can help with gaining more transparency. It’s a tool that will support the Lush buying team to visualise the
supply chain any possible risk and information in one place. By consolidating all the information about the
supply chain in one place it allows for more responsible and productive decisions to be made. In short
SupplyShift helps with supplier management, responsible sourcing and supplier engagement.
The use of SupplyShift will also help us to raise standards and enforcement measures throughout our
supply chains, encourage disclosure, enable us to review policies & get acknowledgment of our policies
from suppliers annually, benchmarking suppliers & tracking progress over time, help us decide where to
utilise the help of third party auditing and set development targets for suppliers who might not meet our
buying policy standards yet.
Further to SupplyShift we have also decided to work with Maplecroft, a global research house and data
analytics organisation that helps with data modelling, risk analysis & forecasting at country and industry
level. This enables Lush to have access to 10+ years of Maplecroft data spanning 200 risk indices across
198 countries.
We are currently (December 2019) in the implementation phase of the Supplyshift and Maplecroft systems
and are excited about this new collaboration and to see where this will take us over the next year.
We have also set up a whistleblowing email address b
‘ lowthewhistle@lush.co.uk’ which is published on
the Lush website.
Where possible, we work directly with suppliers and producers, but long-distance relationships take work
which is why we conduct regular visits to our overseas ( and UK) suppliers to see their operations. Our

buyers take the information gathered from our online survey along to these visits as it forms a good basis
for an internal audit.
There are many ways that a company can ensure that their internal practices are transparent and honest –
and one of the best ways is to allow oversight of these internal practices by outside agencies. There are
several areas of our business where external bodies exist that can check and verify our work. Expert eyes
from outside the company can give reassurance and confirmation to customers that we are doing the
things we say in our written policies and give guidance to us for future developments and improvements.

In 2019/2020 Lush will undergo the Stronger Together Organisational Performance Assessment. The OPA
has been developed to support companies to evaluate their progress in tackling modern slavery and to
inform their next steps
to improve the scope and effectiveness of their programmes. The OPA analyses gaps, reports on
strengths and provides detailed recommendations and action plans to support a business to make further
organisational improvement.
The assessment is delivered by a trained and approved business and human rights expert consultants and
will provide independent verification of the company’s progress in tackling modern slavery.
At the end of the assessment, Lush will receive an overview report with progress scores across all policies
and practices we have in place to tackle modern slavery, as well as detailed expert recommendations to
support step by step change and ongoing continuous improvement.
Our UK based creative buying team and ethical compliance team works hard to look after our policies.
They make sure the policies are implemented in practice on a daily basis and work closely with our global
buying teams based in our five other manufacturing countries.
They look into all new suppliers to ensure everyone in our supply chain, that we source from and give our
money to, is in line with our non-animal testing and other buying policies.
We care about the welfare of everyone in our supply chains - we have processes in place for our raw
material supply chains and in 2019/20 we are going to work on reviewing and revising processes for other
supply chains within the business.

“Modern Slavery” is the phrase used to describe the crimes of human
trafﬁcking, slavery and slavery like practices such as servitude, forced
labour, forced or servile marriage, the sale and exploitation of children,
and debt bondage.
A common thread runs through all of these offences: they involve one person depriving
another person of their liberty, in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain.

2018 Statement - Combating Modern Slavery - Lush Fresh Handmade Cosmetics UK

slavery and this ﬁgure continues to grow as global migration reaches an all-time high. The
Lush group take a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery of any kind and are committed
to helping end these practices in any way that we can. People are at the heart of everything
we do and we care about the welfare of everyone in our supply chains.
To combat the risks of modern slavery and human trafﬁcking in our own business and in our
supply chains, we have taken (and continue to take) steps that we are proud to share with you
in this statement.
This year, we have been focusing heavily on our raw material supply chains and have raised
the bar on our standards and enforcement measures ensuring our suppliers are consistently
up to the mark.
Our business
Lush is a UK cosmetics brand, originally founded in 1995, now trading with 933 retail stores in
49 countries employing over 18,000 employees.
We are very proud to offer a range of over 300 fresh, handmade, cosmetic products which are
manufactured at our 7 manufacturing sites across the world and sold through our retail shops
and digital channels.
The Lush business is run in accordance with a set of founding ethical principles written by our
founders at the very beginning of Lush’s life, commonly known as our ‘We Believe
Statement’. These principles underpin all that we do and run through every vein of our
business.
Our supply chains
We have many supply chains that contribute to the operation of our business and as the Lush
business continues to grow in size, so do our supply chains.
For example, our raw material supply chains are made up of a network of approximately 330
suppliers all over the world. This number continues to evolve as we discover new materials
and meet new suppliers.
We are committed to sourcing and developing top quality, ethical materials for our products
through a resilient global network. We also grow materials ourselves via agricultural projects
and direct partnerships around the world.
From the early days of buying, we learned the hard way that the adulteration of our essential
oils was down to how we treated our suppliers and the relationships we formed.. As a
business, we realised that we could have both a positive and negative impact through our

relying on positive and open relationships with our suppliers and producers to ﬁnd a path to a
truly ethical and sustainable business that will last into the future.
Our vision is that each and every ingredient we purchase is helping contribute to a positive
future.
We are already building a web of like minded pioneers who wish to become part of the answer
to the problems we all see everyday. Through the ingredients we buy and through the people
we meet and partner with, we are ﬁnding that some of these answers come through reciprocal
trade. That means ﬁnding ways in which we can grow, produce, manufacture and ship our
goods that are truly sustainable. And not just sustainable but beyond that - regenerative.
That they put back more into the soil, to the community and the natural world than they take
and at the same time provide proﬁt and a viable business for all of us.
Policies and Practices
We have several policies in place that help us to enforce the standards set to prevent the risk
of Modern Slavery in our supply chains and also encourage disclosure of any such practices
within our business and throughout our supply chains. These policies are reviewed, sent out
and acknowledged by new and existing suppliers annually.
Our Anti-Slavery & Human Trafﬁcking Policy
This policy clearly deﬁnes Lush’s position on Modern Slavery and sets the minimum
standards that we expect all of our suppliers to comply with, to ensure the fair treatment and
well-being of all workers in our supply chains.
Our People Care, Earth Care and Fair Share Buying Policy
These buying policies consist of non-negotiable standards, legal requirements and
progressive standards. The policies help us to ensure that our supply chain matches our core
values including the Anti-Slavery & Human Trafﬁcking policy.
Our Buying Policy Questionnaire
The purpose of this online survey is to open a dialogue and to gather information that will help
Lush identify positive practices in our supply chains and focus on what support might be
needed. This will be sent out annually for all direct suppliers to complete.
Our Whistleblowing Policy
Encourages our employees and anyone in our supply chains to report concerns of illegal or
unethical malpractice within our business or supply chains. The anonymity of

and anyone raising concerns or bringing to our attention practices that do not comply with our
policies is protected. Our central whistleblowing email address ‘blowthewhistle@lush.co.uk’ is
monitored by our Compliance Ofﬁcer and whistleblowing cases are investigated and resolved
in the shortest time possible.
Breaches to these policies are not taken lightly. Where there is opportunity to inﬂuence
change we will work hard with our suppliers to do so. The additional information from our
policy questionnaire enables us to benchmark suppliers and practices to keep tracking
progress against each of the areas covered by our buying policy.
Taking responsibility
The Lush board of directors have overall responsibility for ensuring Lush's compliance with
the Modern Slavery Act and that all those under our control comply with it. Our Compliance
Ofﬁcer has day-to-day responsibility for implementing this policy, monitoring its use and
dealing with any queries about it. Management at all levels are responsible for ensuring those
reporting to them understand the issue of modern slavery and comply with this policy.
Due Diligence
This year, we have been working hard to develop a system that will enable us to work more
efﬁciently to monitor and work with our raw material suppliers to ensure we are meeting the
highest ethical standards possible throughout our supply chain.
This has seen the introduction of:
Our People Care, Earth Care and Fair Share Buying Policy & Declaration
A digital Policy Questionnaire which is linked to a data analysis software
Improved Whistleblowing Policy
Country and industry risk mapping
Where possible, we work directly with suppliers and producers, but long distance
relationships take work which is why regular visits to our suppliers to see their operations are
important to us. Just as important is meeting our suppliers here in the UK.
There are many ways that a company can ensure that their internal practices are transparent
and honest – and one of the best ways is to allow oversight of these internal practices by
outside agencies. There are several areas of our business where external bodies exist that can
check and verify our work. Expert eyes from outside the company can give reassurance and
conﬁrmation to customers that we are doing the things we say in our written policies and give
guidance to us for future developments and improvements.

2018 Statement - Combating Modern Slavery - Lush Fresh Handmade Cosmetics UK

We have an internal team that works hard to look after our policies. They make sure the
policies are implemented in practice on a daily basis. The team is spread over all of Lush’s
manufacturing countries (UK, North America, Brazil, Croatia, Germany, Japan and Australia)
and work closely with our global buying teams. They look into all new suppliers to ensure
everyone in our supply chain, that we source from and give our money to, is in line with our
non-animal testing and other buying policies.
Training and Raising Awareness
A lot of people work for Lush. All of them need to have an active and engaged understanding
of the risks of modern slavery to our business. This year, we have started to roll out training to
key teams within the business to educate them on these risks and indicators of modern
slavery. The closer they are to our supply chains, the more targeted and in-depth this training
tends to be.
This year, our buying, property, and project management teams have all received training via
the Ethical Trading Initiative and we aim to roll out this training to new areas of the business
over the next year. With this experience, our staff are more likely to identify possible warning
signs and raise issues if a supplier looks like they might be slipping below our expected
standards.
Our Anti-slavery and Human Trafﬁcking policy and Modern Slavery statements are published
on our website where staff, suppliers, customers and anyone with an interest can read about
the risks to our business and the steps we are taking to combat modern slavery.
Effectiveness in combating slavery and human trafﬁcking
We use key performance indicators to measure how effective we’ve been in combating
slavery and human trafﬁcking in our business and supply chains.
The KPI’s we will be using this year to measure our success are:
Number of suppliers visited and audited by our Buying Team.
Number of suppliers audited by a third party.
Number of slavery reports received.
Level and depth of Internal and External training
Number of suppliers that completed our buying questionnaire.
Number of development targets met by suppliers to help improve working conditions.
Identifying high risk countries and industries for Modern Slavery.
Something to shout about - The move from Natural Mica
Lush ﬁrst started buying materials containing natural mica back in 2012. We chose suppliers
based on the guarantees that children were not working in production, and had audit reports

to verify this. Our supplier at the time was working with a local NGO called BBA (Save the
Childhood foundation), which works with whole villages to accomplish ‘child friendly villages.
Unfortunately, the pigment division of the company was old to another company. Lush Buyer,
Gabbi explains: “We were told that the company could no longer offer the same external, third
party auditing or veriﬁcation. The new suppliers remained adamant that there was no child
labour involved but because we no longer had veriﬁcation of that fact by an independent
company this raised a concern. It was then that we decided to switch all of our materials
containing natural mica to a synthetic-based mica instead.”
In 2014, Lush started working to replace all ingredients containing natural mica with a
synthetic mica based version.
When we were no longer able to guarantee transparency in the supply chain, we decided to
make the change to synthetic mica.
Gabbi explains: “For us it was to do with the sourcing practises behind natural mica. It
became clear that we couldn’t get the transparency that we wanted in our natural mica supply
chains, so we decided synthetic mica was a better and more ethical option for us”
In 2016 natural mica was discovered in a range of mica pigments that we were told were
synthetic. Gabbi explains: “This discovery was a real shock for us and highlighted the need for
really tight controls. So it wasn’t just that it was our ethical preference not to use natural mica,
it was absolutely something our suppliers had to fully commit to and conﬁrm that they would
not use natural mica in anything that they supplied us with.”
We are now happy to conﬁdently say that as of the 1st January 2018, no natural mica has
been used in the production of Lush products.
Supporting Human Rights Charities
At Lush, we like to look after those who look after others, and we are committed to supporting
small, grassroots groups and other non-proﬁt Human Rights organisations.
This ﬁnancial year, in the UK alone, we have donated over £480,000 to Human Rights
charities, including groups supporting anti-slavery practices such as human trafﬁcking.
A full list of the charities we have supported can be found on our website at:

Statement Against
Modern Slavery
Google LLC (Google) and its subsidiaries and controlled entities--including Google UK Ltd., Google Australia Pty
Ltd., Nest Labs, Inc. (Nest), Nest Labs (Europe) Ltd., Google Payment Ltd., and DeepMind Technologies Ltd.--are
committed to treating all workers with respect and dignity, ensuring safe working conditions, and conducting
environmentally responsible ethical operations. As a part of our overall commitment to supporting human rights
around the world, we stand against all forms of modern slavery, and we work to ensure it will not find a foothold
in our supply chains and business operations
We are issuing this statement pursuant to the UK Modern Slavery Act, Australia Modern Slavery Act, and the
California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, which require Google and certain of its subsidiaries to disclose
efforts to ensure that modern slavery is not taking place in our supply chains and business operations. This is
our fourth statement, covering our 2019 financial year (January 1 - December 31, 2019).
Google’s subsidiaries and controlled entities currently participate in and are covered by the anti-modern slavery
program operated by Google. As a result, statements regarding Google’s efforts to ensure that modern slavery is
not taking place in its supply chains and business operations—including statements regarding the company’s
policies, processes, and procedures—also apply to Google’s subsidiaries and controlled entities unless
specifically stated otherwise.
Throughout this statement, we reference “modern slavery,” which includes slavery, servitude, forced or
compulsory labor, and human trafficking. In addition, we reference “extended workforce suppliers” and “our
extended workforce,” which includes suppliers and supplier employees.

2019 Highlights
Supplier Risk Assessment
We completed a supply chain human rights risk assessment that included components specific
to modern slavery.

Responsible Supply Chain
We published our 2019 Responsible Supply Chain Report.

Charitable Giving
Google and Googlers contributed over US$4.5M in 2019 to 81 organizations fighting modern slavery,
including those on the Global Modern Slavery list.

Extended Workforce Reporting
In 2019, we simplified and clarified the way our extended workforce can raise concerns by
launching a dedicated platform that centralizes the internal reporting process when concerns
are raised to Google.

Structure, business, and supply chain
Google is a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. (Alphabet). Google’s
business includes our main products, such as Google Ads, Android,
Chrome, Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, as
well as hardware products, such as Google Nest home products,
Pixelbooks, Pixel phones, and other devices. In addition, our business is
supported by a significant amount of technical infrastructure, including data
centers located in the U.S. and other countries. Google generates revenues
primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content
products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees
received for Google Cloud offerings and subscription-based products. Our
anti-modern-slavery efforts require strong collaboration and engagement
with our global suppliers that manufacture products or provide services on
our behalf.
Google is a large purchaser of goods and services required for business
operations. We work with more than 2,000 suppliers worldwide that support

Internal management, accountability, and
programs
In 2019, our VP, Global Ethics and Compliance, oversaw a team focused on
combating modern slavery in our supply chains and business operations.
The VP, Global Ethics and Compliance provided quarterly updates on the
status of our anti-modern-slavery program to our Compliance Steering
Committee, composed of senior executives from across our business. In
addition, our VP, Global Ethics and Compliance provided regular updates on
our anti-modern-slavery efforts to the Audit Committee of Alphabet’s Board
of Directors.
Regular updates on the status of the Responsible Supply Chain Program—
which includes addressing modern slavery risk—were provided to our

Global Ethics and Compliance and leaders from the data center, hardware,
and extended workforce business areas.

2019 STATEMENT AGAINST MODERN SLAVERY

Policies addressing ethical conduct and
prevention of modern slavery
As reported in our previous statements, we have an Employee Code of
Conduct and a Supplier Code of Conduct. Our Supplier Code of Conduct
sets supplier expectations designed to protect the health, safety, and
treatment of workers, including the prohibition of any form of modern
slavery, including forced, bonded (including debt bondage), or indentured
labor; involuntary prison labor; sex trafficking; and slavery or trafficking
of people. In 2018, we updated and publicly posted our Policy Against
Modern Slavery to further demonstrate our commitment to combating
modern slavery. The policy defines modern slavery, gives a concrete list
of prohibited actions, and provides reporting channels for suspected
instances of modern slavery. We strive to hold our employees and
suppliers to high standards. Any violation of our standards by a Google
employee can result in disciplinary action, including termination of
employment. Any violation by a supplier can result in contract termination.

Risk assessment

For more information on our ongoing risk assessments and remediations in
our hardware supply chain, please refer to Google’s 2019 Responsible Supply
Chain Report.

Due diligence
We conduct due diligence on direct suppliers that are identified as having
higher risk through the assessments described in the preceding section
(collectively, the “higher-risk suppliers”).
As part of the due diligence process, higher-risk suppliers complete a
self-assessment questionnaire about their working conditions and
management systems. The due diligence process also includes supplier
background checks, examination of labor-related red flags that appear in
publicly available databases and media sources, and a review of higher-risk
suppliers’ names against human trafficking watch lists.
If we discover red flags, we conduct extensive and documented follow-ups
to address these issues. In certain cases, we may decide to no longer
pursue a relationship or to terminate our current relationship with a supplier.
As mentioned previously, based on our risk assessment findings, we have
focused additional due diligence efforts on an identified population of

in APAC, EMEA, and the Americas, and included a range of suppliers from
security services to back office operations. The audits of our extended
workforce suppliers have led to meaningful insights and learnings. In 2020,
we intend to use these insights and learnings to better educate our supplier
managers on specific risks and how they can address root causes.

We also perform periodic third-party audits during office fit-out construction
projects in some regions. With these audits, we strive to ensure that
construction workers have a safe working and living environment (in those
cases where housing is provided for workers) and are paid a wage in a
timely fashion commensurate to the work performed. This is achieved by
announced and unannounced visits to relevant facilities, interviews with
workers, and inspection of personnel files. Appointed general contractors
are contractually bound to allow similar audits of their subcontractors, as
appropriate.

2019 STATEMENT AGAINST MODERN SLAVERY

Because we recognize the limitations of audits in many areas, we have
ongoing efforts to improve our protocols and to identify and assess risk
using a variety of other methods and indicators. We also engage with
workers through individual and group interviews, as well as tablet-based
worker surveys. In 2019, we began working on expanding our worker
surveys to a larger population of suppliers with guidance and direction from
our internal privacy experts, to ensure that any personally identifiable

Our commitment to ending modern slavery
In addition to the measures described above, we support a number of other efforts and organizations as part of our
commitment to eradicating modern slavery.

Related policies
Advertising: Our advertising policies do not allow ads containing adult-oriented content that targets minors, ads promoting sexually
explicit content, including content with underage or non-consensual sexual themes, ads for compensated sexual acts, or ads that
violate applicable laws or regulations for any location that a campaign targets (collectively, “bad ads”). We enforce our policies
through a robust approval and monitoring process. We use the latest technology as well as manual review by teams that are specially
trained to remove bad ads—and bad advertisers—from Google. This is a constant challenge, and we are always seeking ways to
ensure our systems and practices stay ahead of the evolving risk.
Google Play: Our policies do not allow apps that contain or promote sexually explicit content, such as pornography and escort
services.

Product features
Search feature: We continue to support a Search feature that helps victims of modern slavery to more easily access critical support
and services from anti-modern-slavery organizations. Specifically, when certain keywords are used in Search, this feature will show
hotline phone numbers, operating hours, and easy-to-use text short codes. The feature is available in 13 countries and 15 languages.
User engagement: We provide robust tools to help our users report illegal content or abuse in our services, including community
flagging tools. We also invite users to contact us with complaints about illegal content or abuse through our product Help Centers.

Partnerships
Protecting Children: Google’s Special Victims Investigation Group investigates cases involving online child sexual exploitation,
making reports to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). This initiative involves innovation in locating
children being exploited to expedite their potential rescue.
UK Living Wage initiative: The Living Wage Foundation is an initiative that annually calculates a minimum hourly living wage for the UK,
generally, and in London, specifically. Google UK worked with the Living Wage Foundation to certify the steps it takes to ensure Google
UK employees, suppliers, and vendors receive a living wage. Google UK is proud to have earned accreditation as a Living Wage employer
for the fourth year in a row.
Responsible Mining: Google is a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), which has a variety of programs addressing
the risk of child mining. RMI is supporting a collaboration with PACT, a nonprofit international development organization, on a
project that has set out to eliminate child labor in cobalt and tin mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The effort
involves working in-region with NGOs and governmental entities to assess the current state of child mining, identify root causes,
and develop mitigation plans to ultimately eliminate child mining by providing economic alternatives to families. This effort builds
on previous work done by PACT in collaboration with Google and other companies in the DRC.
Industry Collaboration: To support industry innovation and collaboration, we engage with the BSR Human Rights Working Group
(HRWG), Global Business Coalition Against Trafficking (GBCAT), and the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA).

Employee Engagement and Awareness
Charitable giving: Google and Googlers contributed over US$4.5M in 2019 to 81 organizations fighting modern slavery, including those
on the Global Modern Slavery list, including the Bay Area Anti-Trafficking Coalition and the Polaris Project.

workers to conduct due diligence to identify and avoid working with third
parties that engage in modern slavery or other illegal practices. Workers
who manage relationships with higher-risk suppliers identified in our risk
assessment receive supplemental in-person training. In addition, in late
2016, we launched an online training course that includes anti-modern
slavery education for workers in roles related to hardware supplier
management. This training helps workers identify modern slavery red flags,
shares anti-modern slavery best practices, and instructs workers to report
modern slavery concerns. As of the end of 2017, this training has been
completed by over 250 employees managing relationships with higher-risk

Assessing and reporting
on effectiveness
We perform periodic independent third-party audits at higher-risk hardware
and non-hardware suppliers’ facilities. The audits include in-depth factory
tours, meetings with management, on-site worker interviews, document
reviews, and assessments of related areas, such as dormitories, cafeterias,
wastewater treatment facilities, and warehouses. The audit protocol is
designed to assess higher-risk suppliers’ performance in the areas covered
by our Supplier Code of Conduct, including modern slavery risk. We
investigate any issues identified during the audit to determine root causes
and develop corrective action plans. While our audits are announced, our
supplier managers are trained to report any concerns they might observe

document retention practices and interns receiving timely compensation

We also perform periodic third-party audits during office fit-out construction
projects in some regions. With these audits, we strive to ensure that
construction workers have a safe working and living environment (in those
cases where housing is provided for workers) and are paid a wage in a
timely fashion commensurate to the work performed. This is achieved by
announced and unannounced visits to relevant facilities, interviews with
workers, and inspection of personnel files. Appointed general contractors
are contractually bound to allow similar audits of their subcontractors, as
appropriate.
Because we recognize the limitations of audits in many areas, we have
ongoing efforts to improve our protocols and to assess risk using a variety
of other methods and indicators. We have also extended our direct
engagement with workers through individual and group interviews, as well
as tablet-based worker surveys.

Reporting concerns or raising issues

We offer multiple reporting options to workers, including a helpline that
gives callers an option to report concerns anonymously. We promote

In May 2017, Google’s Ethics and Compliance Team hosted Academy Award-winning director Jeffrey Brown and actress Neerja Naik at our San Francisco
office for a screening of their movie, SOLD, followed by a question and answer session. SOLD tells the story of a young girl who is trafficked and forced into sex
slavery and is based on true stories. As part of the screening, we conducted an internal awareness campaign to educate employees on modern slavery risk. In
addition, we worked with Jeffrey Brown to raise money for the India & Nepal Project, a project overseen by the Courageous Girls organization, which provides
assistance to human trafficking survivors.
Google matched over $600,000 of employee donations in 2017 to over 60 organizations on the Global Modern Slavery list, such as the Bay Area Anti-Trafficking

Policy Statement Prohibiting Involuntary Labor*
June 2, 2016
Overview
With 2015 sales of $13.5 billion and more than 1,600 foods, Kellogg is the world's leading cereal company;
second largest producer of cookies, crackers and savory snacks; and a leading North American frozen foods
company. Kellogg Company's more than 1,600 foods are produced in 20 countries on six continents, and
marketed in more than 180 countries.
Our company's vision is nourishing families so they can flourish and thrive. We do this by fulfilling our purpose,
which is to enrich and delight the world through foods and brands that matter. We know that we can only
achieve our vision and purpose when we take into account the greater impact of our foods all along our supply
chain. We are firmly committed to being a responsible global corporate citizen and recognize our duty to
support, promote and advance human rights within our operations and our supply chain.
Our Policy
Kellogg Company prohibits involuntary labor, including forced, indentured, bonded, slave or human-trafficked
labor (""Involuntary Labor""), within our business operations and our supply chain. Involuntary labor is a
pervasive and insidious global issue that directly and negatively impacts basic human rights. We are committed
to protecting human rights and maintaining an ethical and transparent supply chain, free of Involuntary Labor.
As part of doing so, we have embedded our commitment into our Global Supplier Code of Conduct (""Supplier
Code"") and Global Code of Ethics (""Employee Code"").
Our Supplier Code prohibits suppliers from using or facilitating any type of Involuntary Labor. We
reserve the right to terminate our contract with any supplier, at our sole discretion, for violations of
our Supplier Code. We have provided a Global Supplier Code of Conduct Resource Guide as tool to
help suppliers understand our expectations and approach, providing additional information, helpful
definitions, and links to initiatives and other resources which can support them.
Our Employee Code requires employees to obey the law, act with integrity, show respect and do
business with suppliers that embrace and demonstrate high standards of ethical business behavior. It
requires diligence in determining whether our company and its suppliers conform to our standards;
including prohibiting Involuntary Labor and discrimination. All employees are required to comply with
the Employee Code; failure to do so can result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
Our position on human rights is compatible with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
United Nations Guiding Principles, and the core conventions of the International Labour Organization. To
further industry knowledge, collaboration and cooperation, Kellogg is a member of organizations such as AIM-
PROGRESS and the Consumer Goods Forum.
*This policy statement is made pursuant to Transparency in
Supply Chain Act. It constitutes Kellogg Company's anti-slavery and human trafficking statement/disclosure and policy for the financial
year ending December 31, 2015.
Implementation Plan
Kellogg has developed a comprehensive, global corporate responsibility strategy identifying those issues most
relevant to our company and stakeholders. Human rights are one of these issues. We believe it is our duty to
continue educating our internal and external stakeholders on the important issue of Involuntary Labor. We do
so by raising awareness of, increasing our focus on, and taking accountability for ensuring an ethical and
transparent supply chain, free of Involuntary Labor. (More information on our corporate responsibility strategy
is available in our Corporate Responsibility Report at www.KelloggCompany.com.)
Within our operations we are taking steps to ensure awareness, focus and accountability on this
important issue.
To ensure that our employees are aware of our policies, standards and expectations, we utilize
interactive, immersive online training modules that highlight human rights issues like Involuntary
Labor. We are also currently developing additional training courses on this and other human rights
issues.
To ensure the right focus, a more detailed training and discussion regarding the risks and
implications of Involuntary Labor was presented to our global Procurement leaders and managers
during our 2015 Global Procurement Summit.
To ensure accountability, which is an important aspect of Kellogg Company's culture, our Ethics
Office recently updated our Supplier Code and Employee Code to (among other things) raise
awareness of Involuntary Labor. Our Ethics Office is a resource for clarification of company policy
or for reporting issues related to ethics and compliance matters. Employees and suppliers are
strongly encouraged to contact our Ethics Office to report any actual or suspected violations
without fear of retaliation. For convenience and peace of mind, confidential and anonymous
reporting is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year via telephone and
internet web reporting in over 39 languages.
We use social and ethical compliance assessments of our own facilities to verify that Involuntary
Labor does not exist within our operations.
Within our supply chain, we take a risk-based approach to determine which suppliers need additional
awareness and education, or require verification of adherence to our policies, on this and other
responsible sourcing issues.
All suppliers are required to adhere to our Supplier Code, which is included in all new supplier
contracts and agreement. This is a requirement for supplier selection. By the end of 2014, we
determined that responsible individuals at more than 800 companies representing 85 percent of
our global procurement spend had signed the Supplier Code. Should a critical violation of our
policies, such as incidences of Involuntary Labor, be reported or uncovered, Kellogg has an
escalation procedure in place to ensure rapid response and immediate mitigation and remediation
of the issue.
As part of our commitment to being a responsible global corporate citizen, we proactively share
best practices related to social and ethical issues with our suppliers through events such as our
annual company-sponsored Supplier Day conferences. We are committed to actively engaging
with our suppliers and their value chain network to ensure vigilance and adherence to all company
policies.
*This policy statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act and the California Transparency in

Our Commitment

Policies

As a global corporate citizen, we are committed to upholding and advancing the cause of human rights.
Through our responsible sourcing program we focus on social issues that address violations of the
international, regional, and corporate human rights standards that we support and promote.
We are committed to identifying and mitigating salient human rights risks though supplier screening,
assessments, third-party audits, supplier engagement, direct worker feedback, on the ground
interventions, and collaborative partnerships, taking appropriate action in accordance with our policies,
Code of Conduct, and international and national human rights standards.

In 2016, in recognition of our commitment to protecting and advancing
international human rights, we published our Human Rights Position Statement
and Policy Statement Prohibiting Involuntary Labor outlining our expectations and
requirements for both our own operations and our supplier value chain.

Forced labour is one of these issues and we recognize it to be pervasive and profound in its ability to
affect the lives of workers, families, and communities. Along with other salient human rights risks
within our supply chain we are committed to continuing and increasing our efforts to eradicate abuses
and violations.

At the board level, human rights, including forced labour and modern slavery, are overseen by the Social
Responsibility and Public Policy committee, which assists the Board in discharging its oversight
responsibilities with respect to certain social and public policy issues.
At the executive level, these issues are overseen by the Chief Sustainability Officer, who reports to the
Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs. We also convene a cross-functional team comprised of
Sustainability, Communications, Human Resources, Procurement, EHS, and Legal that meets monthly to
assess and track our global activities and inform policy and strategy regarding human rights. Each group is
involved in decisions related to salient industry issues such as child labor, forced labor, freedom of
association and collective bargaining, health and safety, land rights, water and sanitation, and women’s
rights.
At the daily work level these topics are managed collaboratively by our Sustainability, Procurement, Legal,

Our Supply Chain

2018 Supply Chain

We are committed to partnering with our peers and suppliers to find solutions to the issues present within our global supply
chains. Engaging and partnering with our suppliers is essential to our work in the areas of human and workplace rights. We set
clear expectations, seek to drive accountability, and assess potential and actual risk that our supply chain operations may cause or
contribute to, both directly and indirectly.
In 2018 we continued to expand our human rights and forced labour monitoring and compliance verification processes both
internally and externally to build upon our current systems. We know that there is no one-size-fits-all solution in this space and
we are continually looking to improve our methods to ensure we are utilizing our resources to best advance the cause of human
rights in the many regions that we operate.
In 2018, Kellogg has:
• Conducted 20 SMETA 4-Pillar audits for higher risk direct suppliers
• Conducted 7 SMETA 2-Pillar audits for on-site contracted labour providers
• Continued mapping beyond tier 1 risk for global sugar cane suppliers including locations of sourcing, mills and refineries, and
ports of export
• Continued to engage suppliers, measure progress, and provide guidance to suppliers to improve traceability and grievance
reporting within the palm oil supply chain (see our biannual Sustainable Palm Oil Milestones for more information)

Assessing Risk
• Kellogg utilizes a combination of publicly available indices from reputable sources
and Sedex to assess forced labour risk for supplier operations
• Risk factors include regional location of operations, sector or commodity, degree of
salience to industry identified issues, and supplier specific information
• In 2018, Kellogg also began using the service SmartRisk to send real-time risk alerts
gleaned from various online sources to our Procurement department and other
related functions to increase response time to issues as they become known
• Targeted facilities are asked to complete a robust self-assessment detailing policies
and procedures related to labor practices to identify gaps that could indicate the
possibility of or potential for human rights abuses or nonconformance

• Audits include on site worker interviews according to SMETA best practice guidance,
including determining the percentage of workers interviewed

Supply Chain Engagement: Fighting Child Labour in Cocoa Farming Communities in Ghana
In September 2018 Kellogg partnered with supplier Barry Callebaut to kick off a two-year pilot program aimed at remediating and mitigating the risks of child labour in the cocoa farming community of Bonsu
Nkwanta, Ghana. The project consists of a package of interventions designed to provide educational support to the children of cocoa farming families, teacher support to local educators, farmer support, and
community support. The pilot program design is predicated on the idea that to fight child labor holistic community wide solutions are required and that by supporting families and communities we can empower
people with the resources they need to benefit from sustainable long-term change. Rather than quick fix solutions that do not address the root causes of these issues, the complexities and individualities of
specific communities, and the needs of families we seek to affect lasting change and lay the foundation for future success.
The community and its leaders have taken pride in being selected and their support has led to results above and beyond those expected. The District Child Labor Committee (DCLC), which was convened
through this program, has been active in making the best use of program inputs and the community’s eyes are on the children, teachers, and school, helping to increase effectiveness.
Key learnings to date are being incorporated throughout the implementation of the program. The local Technical Officer has reported seeing change in the community as a whole, beyond immediate
beneficiaries. By combining individual child and family-level inputs with those for the community, the benefits of the program multiplied. The community buy-in that was achieved at the beginning of the
program has been critical to its success.
Progress To Date:
• The Parent Teacher Association indicated that school attendance has improved due to the meals being supplied in school
• Seven children who had previously dropped out of school have resumed schooling due to the project. Participant children have
even started showing up early for school, which has compelled other children to do so as well.
• Because teachers are receiving incentives, the village Chief has taken it upon himself to ensure that teacher attendance is high.
• The DCLC has started nightly sessions under the solar street lamp to ensure that children are all doing their homework.
In the first six-months of program implementation the following activities have been completed:

Supply Chain Engagement: Supporting Smallholders and Women in Ecuador
In 2018 Olam and Kellogg partnered to
improve the livelihoods of cocoa farmers and
their communities in Ecuador through the
development and dissemination of training
materials designed to improve agricultural
practices, increase crop diversification, and
develop cocoa and non-cocoa seedling
nurseries. The project is focused on the
cocoa growing regions of Guayas, El Oro, Los
Rios, Santo Domingo, Marabi, and
Esmeraldas.

The cocoa applications detail how to select and
nurture high-yielding cocoa varieties with the
highest probability for success. The non-cocoa
section will teach farmers about growing other
seedlings that are either directly beneficial for the
farm (such as shade trees) or can provide an
alternative source of income (such as citrus fruits).
The overall goal is to develop small-holder farmers’
resiliency to climate change and support women in
the communities through gender empowerment
with targeted workshops.

Access to non-cocoa seedlings is an essential
component to improve biodiversity at the farmlevel and helps to build a farm’s resilience to
extreme weather conditions by:
• Providing access to shade to help cocoa
plantations withstand periods of unusually
intense heat and sunlight, whilst improving
retention of soil moisture in times of drought
• Improving access to plants and trees that serve
as natural barriers to reduce the spread of
disease in times of excess rains and humidity

Access to new crops improves the diversification of
household income, meaning risk is distributed over
a larger number of income streams. This is a key
component to improving the income and economic
stability for smallholder farmers.

Progress To Date:
• 43 Farmer Field Schools held on

Supply Chain Engagement: Improving nutrition, supporting income diversification, and promoting Women’s Empowerment for Smallholders in India
TechnoServe and Kellogg Company announced
the expansion of a training program in India to
improve incomes for thousands of smallholder
maize and wheat farmers - particularly women - to
enhance their skills in climate-smart agriculture
and better support their communities.
This work supports Kellogg’s global signature
cause platform, Breakfasts for Better Days™, by
focusing on climate-smart agriculture (CSA)
techniques to improve livelihoods. Also, investing
in opportunities for women leads to additional
benefits at the household level and beyond. In
addition to training women farmers on CSA, the
program seeks to increase the role women play in
the farm economy while also enhancing the
nutritional intake of households by training
women in organic kitchen gardening.
The project helps women establish backyard
gardens using organic inputs and farming practices
for four nutritionally diverse crops at a time. With
fresh produce in the garden, women gain access
to better quality vegetables at home, saving travel
time and money while diversifying their families’
access to essential nutrients.

Saroj Bai is a female farmer from rural
Madhya Pradesh, and like many
smallholder farmers her family survives on
agricultural income. The average nutrient
consumption in this part of India is below
the recommended dietary intake. She
struggled to include vegetables in her
family’s daily meal, and could incorporate
them less than three times a week due to
low output from her kitchen garden. Using
conventional methods meant low
productivity due to poor quality soil and
pest and rodent attacks
Through this partnership, TechnoServe and Kellogg are
helping to improve smallholder farmers’ incomes and
resilience in Madhya Pradesh. More than 2,060 women
have received training in kitchen gardening and backyard
vegetable cultivation that can provide an additional
source of income as well as nutritious produce. The
training modules cover nutrition and sustainable
gardening practices such as field preparation, low-cost
organic fertilizer preparation, and post-harvest care of
vegetables.

“I have increased the
area of my organic
kitchen garden. I want
my family to consume
vegetables in every
meal. The program has
given us— the female
farmers of the
community—
confidence that we can
consume vegetable in
every meal and also
earn income by selling
the produce from OKG.”

Moving Forward

CGF Priority Industry Principles On Forced Labor

As we continue our responsible supply chain journey we will continue to build awareness and share best practices regarding
salient human rights issues throughout our operations. We remain committed to further expanding our efforts to increase
visibility and transparency into the lower tiers of our highest risk areas and commodities.

Kellogg supports the CGF Priority Industry Principles on Forced Labour for
both our own operations and our suppliers. As with other policies, we
require the dissemination and adherence of these principles throughout
our supply chain.

We will also seek ways to better partner with our suppliers to ensure that all within our value chain operate in accordance
with our policies and requirements and provide guidance those that need to improve or remove those that fail to meet
expectations of engagement. We know that the tools to build a sustainable and ethical supply base are often found through
activities deemed to be “beyond compliance”. We will continue increasing our efforts, through robust policies and
procedures to ensure the fair and appropriate representation of all affected stakeholders.

Mondelēz International is committed to do business the right way and to its
responsibility to respect human rights. We subscribe in principle to the
United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs),
as a framework for preventing and addressing the risk of adverse impact on human rights by
businesses.
Slavery, servitude, forced labor and human trafficking (“modern slavery”) are issues of increasing
global concern, affecting and many sectors around the world. Modern slavery is fundamentally
unacceptable within our operations and supply chains and is an important element of our
commitment to respect human rights.
This report sets out the steps taken by Mondelēz International during the course of 2018 to prevent,
identify and address human rights and modern slavery risks in our operations and supply chains. It
meets the requirements of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, the UK Modern Slavery
Act 1, and the Australian Modern Slavery Bill.

Cocoa supply chain: By end of 2018, 43% of the cocoa volume for our
chocolate brands is sourced sustainably through our Cocoa Life program,
and we aim to deliver 100% by 2025. The program invests in cocoa
farming communities in Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Indonesia, Brazil, the
Dominican Republic and India, and already works with more than 142,000
farmers. Our main cocoa suppliers are listed as partners on our Cocoa Life
website. And the GPS mapping of close to 63% of the farms which are part
of the program are already available here.

•

Wheat supply chain: We source most of our wheat from Europe and
North America. In Europe, through our Harmony program we partner
with 1,700 farmers, 13 millers and 21 cooperatives across six countries
(Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Italy, Poland and Spain). In 2018,
they produced 232,000 tons of wheat, representing 75% of our West
European biscuit production. By 2022, we aim to cover 100% of our
biscuit production across the European Union. In North America, we
partner with wheat farmers, who are adopting innovative practices to optimize pesticide and
fertilizer use, growing all the wheat we need for our Triscuits brand, with a lower
environmental footprint.

•

Palm oil supply chain: We purchase around 0.5% of worldwide palm oil
production and source it predominantly from Malaysia and Indonesia,
and to a lesser degree from other countries. As of 2017, in line with our
Pail Oil Action Plan, we have achieved the traceability of 96% of our palm
oil to the mill and 99% of the palm oil we buy was sourced from suppliers
with policies aligned to ours. The list of suppliers and mills that make up
our palm oil supply is available on our website.

Governance Structure for Human Rights
The Mondelēz International Human Rights Working Group (HRWG) defines the company’s human
rights due diligence strategy and drives its implementation to embed it throughout the organization’s
own operations and supply chains.
The HRWG meets monthly in order to:
•

Maintain the company’s human rights due diligence strategy, in line with company values
and commitment to respect human rights under the UNGPs

•

Oversee the implementation of the strategy and embedding of human rights due diligence
throughout the organization and our business relationships

•

Review and ensure appropriate action is taken to address human rights risks surfaced by due
diligence systems

The HRWG is a cross-functional group made up of senior representatives and is sponsored by the
heads of the following functions or their direct reports: Impact, Human Resources, Business Integrity,
Procurement and Manufacturing.
The HRWG reports quarterly to the Impact Steering Committee, and bi-annually to the Board of
Directors’ Governance, Membership & Public Affairs Committee (GMPAC).

Policies and contractual controls
Our Human Rights Statement, our Corporate Responsibility Guidelines and Code of Conduct guide
everything we do as we strive to ensure that human rights are respected within our own operations
and our upstream supply chains. We also seek to do business with partners who share the same
commitment.
Mondelēz International has policies that prohibit child and forced labor as noted in our Code of
Conduct. We also audit our manufacturing facilities under the Program for Responsible Sourcing
(PROGRESS). Failing to meet company standards on child and forced labor is a breach of corporate
policy.
Our supplier contracts include provisions on our Corporate Responsibility Expectations including
forced and child labor.
We encourage and expect our employees to report concerns or questions, including any related to
human rights and modern slavery. This general expectation is detailed in our ‘Speaking Up and
Investigations Policy’, which also affirms our commitment to non-retaliation. Our Integrity HelpLine
and WebLine are made available to our own employees, contractors, and subcontractors, as well as
anyone to use for raising any concerns and to better enable Mondelēz International to appropriately
redress human rights impacts which we have either caused or contributed to.
Due diligence systems and actions to address identified human rights risks
We undertake practical, business minded, proactive, ongoing human rights due diligence to identify,
mitigate and reduce the likelihood of potential and actual human rights impacts within our own
operations, and work with our business partners through our supply chain to achieve the same.
In 2018, as part of our ongoing due diligence activities, the
HRWG undertook a broad assessment of our human rights
risks and due diligence systems with support of the specialized
human rights consultancy twentyfifty ltd. The assessment
included an analysis of previous social audit results and
grievance mechanism data, interviews with internal
stakeholders in key roles and geographies, and an analysis of
external studies. It reconfirmed the need to focus on salient
risks that are shared across the food industry such as child
labor, forced labor, health and safety, freedom of association
and collective bargaining, land rights, water and sanitation,
and women’s rights. The examination of our due diligence and
risk management systems validated good practices and
identified opportunities for improvement to our ways of
working within our own operations and with our suppliers.

Through human rights assessments of
our own operations and supply chain,
we have identified the following salient
human rights risks:
•

child labor

•

forced labor

•

health and safety

•

freedom of association and
collective bargaining

•

land rights

•

water and sanitation

•

women’s rights

Own operations and tier 1 suppliers
For our own operations and tier 1 suppliers, we identify potential human rights issues, including
modern slavery, and monitor compliance with our policies through AIM-PROGRESS, of which we are
a founding member. We use the Sedex Member Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) protocol to evaluate
our internal manufacturing sites and direct suppliers against a common set of corporate social
responsibility standards developed for the consumer goods industry. In addition, before engaging in
new business relationships – and during the course of business, we conduct appropriate and riskbased due diligence, which includes screening potential suppliers against restricted party lists from

authorities worldwide, which may include human rights related information. These systems support
the identification of potential risks, help guide our approach for impact mitigation and monitoring,
and inform our procurement practices.
Upstream supply chains
At Mondelēz International, we have been focusing our sustainability efforts where we can have the
greatest impact. In our raw materials supply chain, our efforts have primarily focused on cocoa and
palm oil because this is where we know that we can make the biggest difference from an
environmental and social perspective. In the cocoa and palm supply chains, we have developed
comprehensive approaches to identify potential human rights impacts through our signature Cocoa
Life program and our Palm Oil Action Plan.
In 2016, we partnered with World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to assess the long-term environmental and
social sustainability risks of our raw materials supply chain. The prioritized risk assessment run by
WWF examined raw materials by source country based on publicly available, secondary data,
covering our largest raw materials volume and spend. The assessment confirmed cocoa and palm oil
as top priorities from a human rights risk perspective. 2
Cocoa supply chain
In the cocoa supply chain, we address human rights risks
through Cocoa Life. Cocoa Life's $400 million, 10-year
commitment aims to empower more than 200,000
farmers and more than 1 million people in cocoa
farming communities in Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Indonesia,
Brazil, the Dominican Republic and India.
When a new community joins the program, our NGO
partners conduct a thorough participatory needs
assessment on focus areas including labor risks such as
forced and child labor. Based on this assessment and with support from our partners, community
members develop a Community Action Plan, which provides a detailed roadmap for community
activation. Based on this plan, and as part of the program’s holistic approach, our partners then
implement a range of activities that address the issues identified.
Child labor
Child labor is a symptom of underlying systemic issues
in the cocoa supply chain such as poverty and slow
rural development. Our Cocoa Life program’s holistic
approach addresses these root causes through
interventions to increase income, empower
communities to advocate for their development, and
the empowerment of women at household and
community level. In addition, in Côte d’Ivoire and
Ghana, where third-party studies including
independent assessments commissioned by Mondelēz International confirmed a significant risk of
child labor, we are setting up a Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System (CLMRS) in all 1,123

Cocoa Life communities. As of the end of 2018, 403 communities were already covered by a CLMRS,
which means people have been sensitized to the dangers of child labor, remediation is under way for
identified vulnerable children, the local school is involved, children are learning about their rights,
and a committee of community volunteers is in place to be the focal point on child protection issues
and to take action when a child is found to be in child labor, in partnership with the local authorities
and with the support of our local NGO partner.
Ending child labor across the West African cocoa sector is more than Mondelēz International can do
alone, so we collaborate with all actors of the cocoa supply chain. Through our involvement with the
World Cocoa Foundation (WCF) and the International Cocoa Initiative (ICI), we support a systemic
approach to address the root causes of child labor and call for strong public-private partnerships with
governments, development partners and civil society organizations. For more on our actions to
address child labor through Cocoa Life: https://www.cocoalife.org/the-program/child-labor
Forced labor
In 2018, the International Cocoa Initiative (ICI), of which we are a founding and Board member,
commissioned Verité to do an independent study of forced labor risk in the cocoa supply chain of
Côte d’Ivoire. The report published in February 2019 concludes that poverty, price volatility in cocoa,
low levels of education, the nature of small-scale
farming and limitations in law enforcement are rootcause factors that drive forced labor. Verité makes
recommendations to the Government of Côte d’Ivoire
and private sector chocolate and cocoa companies.
According to the UNGPs, these collective individuals are
the main actors responsible for protecting and
respecting the rights of children and workers.
Supporting financial literacy initiatives, strengthening
law enforcement, increasing workers’ awareness of
their rights and employers’ awareness of their responsibilities, and reinforcing the organization of
farmers are some of the recommended actions in the report.
Informed by the Verité report and other recent studies, and with the active support of Mondelēz
International, ICI revised its work plan and strategy to support specific interventions that prevent,
detect and respond to forced labor risks. ICI will explore ways to adapt supply-chain monitoring tools
to better capture forced labor risks in high-risk areas, and will work with supply-chain actors,
communities and local authorities to design grievance mechanisms adapted to the hidden nature of
potential labor exploitations in remote rural areas. Mondelēz International is actively contributing
and will use the learnings from these activities to guide our response to forced labor risk through
Cocoa Life.
Women’s rights
Cocoa Life also addresses the striking gender
inequality in cocoa-growing communities, where
women farmers have lower incomes and less access to
financing, inputs and land ownership. In October 2018,
we published renewed Women’s Empowerment
Action Plans for four of our key origins. The action
plans show how, in each origin, we are planning to
empower more women through all areas of our approach – how we will help them: run more
successful farms; take a more active role in community decision making; be able to give their children

a quality education; make cocoa farming more attractive for young people; become more
entrepreneurial; and protect their natural environment. For more on our actions to empower
women through Cocoa Life: https://www.cocoalife.org/the-program/womens-empowerment
For more information on the progress and impact of Cocoa Life take a look at our 2018 Progress
Report.
Palm oil supply chain:
Mondelēz International is committed to sourcing palm oil sustainably and eradicating deforestation
and human rights violations in the palm oil supply. Given the small proportion of the global palm oil
supply that we purchase, our direct impact on the supply chain is limited. Therefore, we seek to use
our influence by engaging with stakeholders to support the transition to sustainable practices across
the palm oil sector, as detailed in our Palm Oil Action Plan.
As of 2018, we have achieved the traceability of 96% of
our palm oil to the mill and 99% of the palm oil we buy
was sourced from suppliers with policies aligned to ours.
In 2018, the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) and its Palm
Oil Working Group, which we co-chair, commissioned
the Fair Labor Association (FLA) to understand forced
labor risks across the Indonesian and Malaysian palm oil
sectors. The FLA report published in November 2018
identifies a number of indicators of forced labor in the
palm oil sector of both countries and highlights the critical role companies can collectively play in
mitigating these risks. Based on the FLA recommendations, the CGF developed an action plan to
address forced labor risks in the Indonesian and Malaysian palm oil sectors, demonstrating and
reconfirming its resolve to work collaboratively to address forced labor issues in the sector.
In April 2019, we released an updated version of our Palm Oil Action Plan to reiterate our
commitment to support the transition to sustainable practices and reflect the latest sustainability
developments in the palm oil sector. In line with our sourcing principles, the plan continues to
require that our suppliers respect the labor rights of all workers, including migrant workers, within
both their own operations and through their supply chains. It now also requires that they embed the
CGF Priority Industry Principles against Forced Labor within their practices in their own operations as
well as in their engagement with third-party suppliers. To ensure progress, we also require suppliers
to provide annual assurance of continuous improvement, verified by third party labor rights experts.

Other supply chains
Beyond our signature programs, we're embedding sustainability into our sourcing practices for other
raw materials. We're seeking more transparency, raising expectations of our suppliers and seeking to
catalyze sector-wide change. Through this work we are addressing cross cutting themes such as good
agricultural practices, deforestation, human rights (including labor rights such as forced and child
labor), land rights, gender and environmental footprint.

Collaborating for change and advocating for human rights due diligence legislation
Achieving widespread change across whole supply chains is more than Mondelēz International can
do alone, so we collaborate with peer companies and expert organizations to help us on the journey.
•

Consumer Goods Forum (CGF): As a board member of the
Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) we have reiterated our
commitment to help eradicate forced labor, and to work
collaboratively with others as these are issues we cannot
resolve alone. We support CGF’s Priority Industry Principles
on Forced Labor. In addition, we co-chair CGF’s
Sustainability Committee.

•

Cocoa sustainability efforts: We join forces with partners in
a range of initiatives to support sustainable cocoa
production including the World Cocoa Foundation where
we serve on the Board of Directors. We also serve on the
Board of Directors of the International Cocoa Initiative (ICI),
a multi-stakeholder platform, whose mission is to help
eliminate child labor and its worst forms (including
trafficking and forced labor), and to promote child
protection in cocoa-growing communities. Through these
platforms, we also call for industry and governments to join
forces to create comprehensive, systemic solutions that
address the root causes of child and forced labor.

•

The CGF has identified three of the most
problematic, yet often common,
employment practices across the world
that can lead to instances of forced
labor. We support these three Priority
Industry Principles on Forced Labor that
should be upheld by as many actors as
possible:
• Every worker should have freedom of
movement
• No worker should pay for a job
• No worker should be indebted or
coerced to work
These principles guide our efforts to
combat forced labor as we continuously
look for ways to strengthen our overall
approach to social sustainability in our
own operations and our upstream
supply chains.

Palm oil sustainability efforts: We co-chair CGF’s Palm Oil
Working Group, which is working to embed the Priority
Industry Principles against forced labor across the palm oil sector. We have served on
the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil Board of Governors between 2014 and 2018 and
continue to support reforms to make sustainable palm oil the norm. We have supported the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Government of Indonesia to develop its
first National Action Plan for palm oil. We are supporting the development of the Coalition for
Sustainable Livelihoods, a group of civil society, private sector, and government organizations
working collectively to strengthen smallholder livelihoods, improve agriculture and conserve
forests in North Sumatra and Aceh, Indonesia.

Beyond our active participation and leadership in collective action platforms, Mondelēz
International has been a vocal advocate in favor of human rights due diligence legislation in the
European Union. Recognizing the systemic nature of human rights issues in global supply chains and
the need for all actors along the supply chain to work together to address them, Mondelēz
International is calling on the EU to adopt legislation to create a level playing field and drive
mainstream adoption of sustainable practices.
This statement has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of Mondelēz
International, Inc on 14 May 2019.

For example, Target collaboratedwith Verit√© to conduct trainings in select markets specifically on the topics of responsiblerecruitment and ethical management of foreign contract workers. Our training materialsemphasize strong social compliance management practices and focus on preventing andmanaging related issues, including human trafficking and forced labor.3 Aileen Robinson[https://wikirate.org/Aileen_Robinson].....2021-04-22 08:58:37 UTC","California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657)

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657)
went into eﬀect in the State of California. Under the law, large manufacturers and retailers
are required to disclose their eﬀorts to eradicate slavery and human traﬃcking within their
supply chains. The law’s underlying purpose is to educate consumers, so they can make
informed decisions and purchase goods from companies that responsibly manage their
supply chains.
At Target, we hold ourselves and our vendors accountable to high ethical standards
wherever we do business. Target works diligently to ensure Target’s products are
produced ethically by our suppliers and in accordance with Target's Standards of Vendor
Engagement (“Target’s Standards”) and Target's Vendor Conduct Guide, which our
suppliers are subject to as a condition of doing business with Target. On November 14,
2016, we announced our enhanced eﬀorts to monitor for forced labor within Target’s
supply chain and our commitment to take swift action when indicators are discovered.
Target, through the engagement of reputable, third-party auditors, veriﬁes compliance with
Target’s Standards for all suppliers producing Target owned-brand goods, Target exclusive
goods and for all national brand products for which Target is the importer of record, all of
whom are required to register their production facilities with Target. In 2016, we conducted
nearly 1,600 unannounced social compliance audits of the registered production facilities.
In 2017 as well as 2018, with the implementation of our enhanced eﬀorts, we increased
that number by over 10%. In 2019 over 1,850 audits were conducted, a 17% increase
over the past three years.
Stakeholder Engagement
In addition to our eﬀorts focused on Target’s supply chain, we also regularly collaborate
with NGOs, brands, governments, international organizations and other expert
stakeholders to help advance working conditions and eliminate forced labor from the
global supply chain more broadly. For example, in 2010 Target adopted the Responsible
Sourcing Network’s No Uzbek Cotton pledge to help eliminate forced labor and human
traﬃcking within the global textile supply chain. In 2018, we updated Target’s policy to
include a ban on Turkmen cotton and in 2020 we included a prohibition on cotton from the
Xinjiang province in China. To further uphold our commitment to human rights we made
an update in 2020 to prohibit the use of all forms of incarcerated labor in our supply chain,
globally, even where legal work release programs exist.
Target is also an active member of several industry and trade association forced labor
working groups, such as the Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee
(COAC) on Forced Labor and the Forced Labor Working Group of the joint trade
associations AAFA, RILA, USFIA, FDRA and NRF. Additionally, we are a founding member
of the Responsible Business Alliance’s Responsible Labor Initiative (visit the
responsiblebusiness.org website). In recognition of our adoption and commitment to
the Employer Pays Principle, Target was admitted into the IHRB’s Leadership Group for
Responsible Recruitment (visit the ihrb.org website). The Leadership Group is a
collaboration between leading companies and expert organizations committed to
improving global recruitment practices of foreign contract workers.
Additionally, we are actively engaging our supply chain partners to collaboratively
implement preventative programs with the International Justice Mission. We also routinely
seek input from experts such as Verité and Impactt as well as other organizations within
the CSO and NGO communities, to help ensure Target’s evolving policies and oversight
practices are eﬀective in helping identify and eliminate unfair, unethical or illegal working
conditions and/or labor practices, including the use of forced labor. Moreover, when
stakeholders share information with us related to potential forced labor circumstances, we

listen. For example, in early 2018, the NGO Transparentem shared with Target that they
had identiﬁed indicators of forced labor at a facility used by one of our vendors in
Malaysia. Although we were no longer doing business with the facility for unrelated
reasons, we took swift action. Those actions entailed working with the facility’s other
customers and a credible third-party expert in forced labor to validate the claims and then
partnering with our vendor, the facility and its other customers to develop and implement
a corrective action plan to address the issues. That work included, among other things,
returning passports to the foreign contract workers employed there, requiring
reimbursement to workers for the recruitment fees they paid to secure their jobs in
violation of the Employer Pays Principle, and overhauling the facility’s management and
hiring practices to ensure the issues would not recur. Now that remediation is complete
and the indicators eliminated, we believe the overall eﬀort will serve as a model for
collective, multi-stakeholder remediation, both for Target and other importers, when
indicators of forced labor are discovered in the supply chain (visit the impacttlimted.com
website).
Veriﬁcation of Product Supply Chains
All production facilities manufacturing Target owned-brand goods, Target exclusive goods
and nationally-branded goods for which Target is the importer of record must be
registered before Target will accept goods produced there. As part of our eﬀorts to verify
our suppliers’ compliance with Target’s Standards and applicable laws, each of those
production facilities must complete a human rights and compliance questionnaire as part
of the registration process, freely and cooperatively submit to responsible sourcing audits
conducted by Target approved third-party auditor partners, and submit those audit reports
to Target. Target utilizes a risk-based approach in supply chain veriﬁcation eﬀorts,
including how we prioritize facility audits. We use a variety risk intelligence sources, and
focus on the operating conditions of the country as well as any product-speciﬁc risks. We
also leverage an internal, cross-functional team of company leaders and compliance
personnel to evaluate proposed shifts or expansions in overseas production to ensure
regional and/or commodity-related risks are accurately identiﬁed and appropriately
weighed.
In addition to our standard audit process, we also assess workforce demographic risks,
and where appropriate, deploy experienced auditors with deep knowledge to conduct a
supplemental assessment speciﬁc to foreign contract workers and supplier recruitment
practices. This supplemental assessment includes reviewing hiring practices, interviewing
labor agencies, analyzing migrant worker conditions, auditing living accommodations and
generally understanding the migrant worker employment experience at a given facility and
we take action on the ﬁndings.
Supplier Audits
Target or our qualiﬁed, third-party audit partners conduct facility audits at registered
facilities to verify our suppliers’ compliance with Target’s Standards. For more information
about Target’s supplier assessments, review Target's Comprehensive Social Compliance
Audit Process. We also regularly conduct product safety and quality assurance audits as
well as CTPAT supply chain security audits (as part of the Customs and Trade Partnership
Against Terrorism program, of which Target is a founding member) at our suppliers’
facilities. Quality/safety and security auditors are trained to spot potential social
compliance concerns (including indicators of forced labor) and to escalate them for further
investigation by our internal and independent third-party investigators.
Certiﬁcation of Compliance with Laws
As an additional condition of doing business with Target, all our suppliers warrant that the
products they supply to Target are manufactured in accordance with all applicable laws,
regulations and standards – both of the United States as well as their country of origin.
Target’s Standards expressly prohibit our suppliers from utilizing any forced or compulsory
labor and accordingly, we expect our suppliers to remediate indicators when identiﬁed.

For additional information, review our Labor & Human Rights policies. Target will not do
business with a vendor that fails to warrant compliance with all applicable laws and will
discontinue doing business with a supplier who fails to live up to that promise. Every year
since 2016, we have reiterated to our suppliers, in writing, Target’s policy and
expectations regarding forced labor. We have also reiterated that this policy and
expectation extends not only to our suppliers’ own operations and production facilities,
but to their upstream material and component suppliers as well.
Accountability
In the spirit of continuous improvement, Target’s approach to forced labor is consistently
evolving as we adopt proven methods, and partner with reputable experts, to help
discover and eradicate it from our supply chain. If forced labor indicators are found in a
supplier’s production facility, we will work quickly to assess the situation and evaluate a
variety of factors including the supplier’s and facility’s ability to remediate, the feasibility of
providing meaningful remedy to impacted workers and the likelihood of sustained
improvement. When remediation is achievable, the supplier is required to work with the
facility, in consultation with Target and industry experts, to develop and implement an
appropriate corrective action program in keeping with our ‘do no harm’ aspiration. If the
situation is not conducive to remediation, then we will work to disengage responsibly from
a facility. For additional information related to supplier performance, probation/termination
processes and training, review Target's Social Compliance Operations. Target also makes
an Integrity Hotline available to Target team members, our suppliers and the workers in
our suppliers’ production facilities. The purpose of the Integrity Hotline is to provide a
vehicle for anonymously reporting concerns dealing with potentially unfair, unlawful or
unethical business practices and to maintain a system through which Target can
investigate claims and address complaints. The system has been an eﬀective mechanism
for identifying issues raised by workers within our suppliers’ production facilities. When
worker allegations are received they are investigated by our global investigations’ team in
partnership, when needed, with independent investigation ﬁrms. At the conclusion of an
investigation, Target takes appropriate actions in light of the ﬁndings, consistent with
Target’s Standards. Such actions may range from Corrective Action Plans and remediation
to the discontinuation of the business relationship.
Target Team Member and Supplier Training
Target administers mandatory training for team members responsible for sourcing and
merchandising decisions on an array of topics, including Target’s Standards and Target’s
Social Compliance program. We also require all team members to comply with
our Business Conduct Guide,which includes an annual review of Target’s Standards.
Target has an extensive library of social compliance training available for our suppliers, as
well as a facility education guide that includes a social compliance section. Target also
provides in-person, in-facility and classroom training options for a variety of compliance
topics, including forced labor and human traﬃcking. For example, Target collaborated
with Verité to conduct trainings in select markets speciﬁcally on the topics of responsible
recruitment and ethical management of foreign contract workers. Our training materials
emphasize strong social compliance management practices and focus on preventing and
managing related issues, including human traﬃcking and forced labor.

Corporate Disclosure in Compliance with SB 657 California Transparency in Supply Chains Act
(Human Trafficking and Anti-Slavery)
Walmar strives to conduct business in a manner that reflects our four basic beliefs – respect for
the individual, service to customers, striving for excellence and acting with integrity. We hold the
same expectations of our suppliers.
The Responsible Sourcing program has its origins in 1992, when Walmar first established Standards
for Suppliers. While our Standards have evolved over the years, they continue to represent
Walmar ’s fundamental expectations of suppliers on social and environmental practices. The
Standards currently cover several topics, including a requirement that suppliers exclude involuntary
labor—including underage, forced, coerced, bonded, involuntary prison, exploited, trafficked or
indentured labor—from their operations and supply chain. We incorporate these Standards into our
supplier agreements.
Walmar recognizes that responsible sourcing requires more than monitoring facilities for
compliance. Walmar utilizes a multi-front approach focused on leveraging collaborations,
promoting training and capacity building, and providing motivation to remediate and continuously
improve.

Verification
We are continually evaluating risks in our supply chain, including potential risk of forced labor and
human trafficking. Our current formal approach to assessing risk in our supply chain utilizes
Worldwide Governance Indicators from the World Bank, which incorporate factors like government
effectiveness, rule of law, control of corruption and government stability that can affect the risk of
non-compliance in facilities producing goods in that country. Walmar also monitors risk through
the facility auditing program and investigations.
Because forced labor and human trafficking are complex issues that can extend beyond the scope
of our Responsible Sourcing audit program, dialogue and collaboration can be an effective way to
identify risk. Walmar continues to par icipate in collaborative effor s with external stakeholders to
advance the goal of identifying risk and building a more transparent supply chain. Additionally, we
par icipate in industry groups that serve as a vehicle to share experiences and gain new information
that can help improve operations and the supply chain.

Auditing
Suppliers are responsible for disclosing all facilities to Walmar that fall within Walmar ’s disclosure
scope. We use third-par y social, safety and environmental compliance audits to evaluate whether
disclosed facilities’ practices meet the requirements set for h in our Standards for Suppliers.
Any facility disclosed to Walmar may be subject to an audit at any time; however, our audit
program allocates audit resources based on risk so we can drive the biggest impact to the countries
that need it most in our broad and diverse supply chain. We place disclosed facilities into one of
three risk categories based on the Worldwide Governance Indicators from the World Bank. The risk
category of the country in which a facility is located determines the requirements of that facility
under our audit program. Audit requirements for different risk categories are described in more
detail here.

Where an audit is required, Walmar requires its suppliers to obtain that audit from one of several
recognized third-par y programs and to send the audit repor to Walmar . Several Walmar approved audit programs have identified forced labor and human trafficking as a point of focus and
have developed audit protocols, training, and tools to help suppliers identify and address risk
factors for forced labor and human trafficking.
Walmar reviews audits and assigns the audited facility a color rating based on the severity of the
findings from the audit. The ratings are provided to all suppliers using the audited facility, and these
suppliers are responsible for working with facilities to remediate the findings. The audit rating is
one tool used to determine whether the facility can remain active and produce for Walmar .

Cer ification
Walmar ’s Standards for Suppliers contain several provisions outlining suppliers’ responsibilities
with respect to eliminating involuntary labor from their supply chains and provide that a signed
supplier agreement, acceptance of a purchase order, and/or provision of merchandise to Walmar
constitutes acceptance of the Standards and serves as the supplier’s continuing affirmation of
compliance. Additionally, when a supplier discloses a new facility to Walmar , the supplier is
required to cer ify to Walmar that, to the best of its knowledge, all facilities the supplier uses for
production of goods for sale by Walmar comply with Walmar ’s Standards for Suppliers.

Internal Accountability
We require all Walmar associates to comply with our Global Statement of Ethics. Suppliers,
contractors and service providers are expected to act ethically, and all suppliers providing product
to Walmar for retail sale are required to comply with Walmar ’s Standards for Suppliers and our
Responsible Sourcing program expectations. We investigate issues and take the appropriate action
to address those issues, up to and including termination of associates and termination of
agreements with suppliers and contractors. Read more about supplier accountability and
consequences here and facility consequences here.

Training
The manner in which we manage our purchase orders can have a significant impact on suppliers and
facilities. Responsible Sourcing is training Walmar supply chain decision-makers (merchandisers,
buyers and sourcing managers) on how their decisions can potentially impact facility working
conditions and equipping them with the necessary knowledge to reinforce to suppliers the
impor ance of positive facility labor practices. At Walmar , we believe associate education is
fundamental to fully integrating labor compliance and social responsibility into all purchasing
decisions and to building a responsible supply chain.

Modern Slavery & Trafficking

Modern Slavery & Traf cking

Bank of Ireland Group
Modern Slavery & Human Trafficking Statement
Our Approach
We strive to ensure that modern slavery or human trafficking does not support our supply chain or our businesses. This objective
is explicit in our relevant policies and our approach to human rights.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 with respect to the financial year ending 31
December 2018 and sets out the approach Bank of Ireland Group has in place to prevent the occurrence of modern slavery and
human trafficking in our supply chain or in any of our business operations in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.

Our Business
Bank of Ireland Group is one of the largest financial services groups in Ireland with total assets of €123.7 billion as at 31
December 2018. The Group provides a broad range of banking and other financial services. These services include: current
account and deposit services, overdrafts, term loans, mortgages, business and corporate lending, international asset financing,
leasing, instalment credit, invoice discounting, foreign exchange facilities, interest and exchange rate hedging investments, life
assurance, pension and protection products. All of these services are provided by the Group in Ireland with selected services
being offered in the United Kingdom and internationally. In the United Kingdom these include Bank of Ireland (UK) plc, a
separately authorized and regulated banking and financial services business, and NIIB Group Limited, an asset finance and
consumer lending group.
You can find out more about the Group’s trading divisions in all jurisdictions, and a list of its products and serviceshere.

Our Policies
The Group operates a number of policies which reflect our objective to acting ethically and in line with our legal and regulatory
obligations with regard to our employees, customers and our business relationships.
The Group Code of Conduct is the standard that we set ourselves for what we say and do in our relationships with our
customers, suppliers, colleagues, shareholders, regulators, government bodies and other parties. The Code represents our
approach to the standards we expect from each other and it prescribes a set of behaviours expected of all employees of the
Bank of Ireland Group, wherever they work. We organise these standards under four principles with clear lines of individual
responsibility:
Customers – we treat customers fairly;
Conduct – we act with integrity in our dealings;
Colleagues – we are respectful to each other and value the contribution of others;
Compliance – we comply with the Code, our policies and applicable legal and regulatory obligations.
The Group Speak Up Policy details the procedures our employees should follow if they have concerns about any wrongdoing,
unlawful conduct, bribery, financial malpractice, dangers to the public or the environment, or possible fraud or other risks to the
Bank of Ireland Group.
The Group Resourcing Policy outlines our approach to recruiting employees for jurisdictions in which the Bank of Ireland
Group operates. The principles of equality underpin our resourcing activity, seeking to ensure that inter-alia recruitment and
selection processes are designed to support fairness
Group Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy standard applies to all directors, officers and employees of the Bank of Ireland
Group, as well as third parties such as suppliers and sets out the rules with regard to bribery and corruption.
Group Anti-money Laundering Policy applies to all our employees and sets out policies and procedures to prevent the
commission of financial crime and the movement of money which has derived from crime.

Group Procurement Policy sets out the requirements for the effective and consistent management for the procurement of
Goods and Services for the Group while ensuring that consistent procurement best practices are followed across the Group
Group Sourcing Risk Policy sets out the requirements for the effective and consistent management of sourcing related
operational risks within the Group.

Our Supply Chain
As the Group is not in an industry with a high risk of modern day slavery, a risk based approach has been adopted to review
supply chains that fall within industries that carry a high risk of modern day slavery.
In conducting appropriate due diligence, the Group assesses its suppliers across a number of key risk areas, at the on-boarding
stage for all suppliers and annually thereafter for suppliers providing services of high criticality and dependency to the Bank.
The Group seeks assurances (where appropriate) from our suppliers that they are complying with applicable laws and
regulations including laws relating to minimum wages, working conditions, overtime, child labour and other applicable labour
and environmental laws. This allows us to select suppliers to work with us who adhere to appropriate standards.
Detailed financial analysis and assessment of suppliers, reputations and experience is carried out. We also seek to identify if
our suppliers operate a vendor management programme and carry out due diligence on their own suppliers to ensure that
appropriate standards are being passed through the supply chain.
Our suppliers are required to notify us of a breach of applicable laws or regulations and outline their practices and procedures to
ensure they do not engage in modern slavery (including their own supply chain). This includes monitoring the content of modern
slavery and human trafficking statements published by our suppliers and completing additional assurance activity when we visit
our supplier sites.

Training and Awareness
Bank of Ireland Group is focused on raising awareness of the policies listed above with colleagues across the organisation. This
includes the provision of mandatory training for employees on the Group Code of Conduct and Speak Up Policy each year.
Our managers also receive further support that includes training and line management guidance to ensure consistency of our
recruitment processes, management of suppliers, fair treatment at work, and inclusion and diversity.

Court of Directors Approval
Responsibility for ensuring that the Group has appropriate policies in place to meet our obligations under the Modern Slavery Act
rests with the Court of Directors.
This Statement has been approved by the Court of Directors on 22nd January 2019, and will be reviewed annually.

Modern Slavery & Human Trafficking Statement
Our Approach
We strive to ensure that modern slavery or human traﬃcking does not support our supply chain or our
businesses. This objective is explicit in our relevant policies and our approach to human rights.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 with respect to the
ﬁnancial year ending 31 December 2019 and sets out the approach Bank of Ireland Group has in place to
prevent the occurrence of modern slavery and human traﬃcking in our supply chain or in any of our
business operations in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.
Our Business
Bank of Ireland Group is one of the largest ﬁnancial services groups in Ireland with total assets of €132
billion as at 31 December 2019. The Group provides a broad range of banking and other ﬁnancial
services. These services include: current account and deposit services, overdrafts, term loans, mortgages,

leasing group.
You can ﬁnd out more about the Group’s trading divisions in all jurisdictions, and a list of its products and
services here.
Our Policies
The Group operates a number of policies which reﬂect our objective to acting ethically and in line with
our legal and regulatory obligations with regard to our employees, customers and our business
relationships.
The Group Code of Conduct is the standard that we set ourselves for what we say and do in our
relationships with our customers, suppliers, colleagues, shareholders, regulators, government
bodies and other parties. The Code represents our approach to the standards we expect from each
other and it prescribes a set of behaviours expected of all employees of the Bank of Ireland Group,
wherever they work. We organise these standards under four principles with clear lines of individual
responsibility:
1. Customers – we treat customers fairly;
2. Conduct – we act with integrity in our dealings;
3. Colleagues – we are respectful to each other and value the contribution of

others;
4. Compliance – we comply with the Code, our policies and applicable legal and
regulatory obligations.
The Group Speak Up Policy details the procedures our employees should follow if they have
concerns about any wrongdoing, unlawful conduct, bribery, financial malpractice, dangers to the
public or the environment, or possible fraud or other risks to the Bank of Ireland Group.
The Group Resourcing Policy outlines our approach to recruiting employees for jurisdictions in
which the Bank of Ireland Group operates. The principles of equality underpin our resourcing
activity, seeking to ensure that inter-alia recruitment and selection processes are designed to
support fairness.
Group Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy applies to all directors, officers and employees of the
Bank of Ireland Group, as well as third parties such as suppliers and sets out the rules with regard to
bribery and corruption.
Group Anti-money Laundering Policy applies to all our employees and sets out policies and
procedures to prevent the commission of financial crime and the movement of money which has
derived from crime.
Group Procurement Policy sets out the requirements for the effective and consistent
management for the procurement of Goods and Services for the Group while ensuring that
consistent procurement best practices are followed across the Group.
Group Sourcing Risk Policy sets out the requirements for the effective and consistent
management of sourcing related operational risks within the Group
Our Supply Chain
As the Group is not in an industry with a high risk of modern day slavery, a risk based approach has been
adopted to review supply chains that fall within industries that carry a high risk of modern day slavery.
In conducting appropriate due diligence, the Group assesses its suppliers across a number of key
risk areas, at the on-boarding stage for all suppliers and annually thereafter for suppliers providing
services of high criticality and dependency to the Bank.
The Group publishes a Code of Supplier Responsibility that sets out our expectations of our
suppliers, and it seeks assurances (where appropriate) from our suppliers that they are complying
with applicable laws and regulations including laws relating to minimum wages, working conditions,
overtime, child labour and other applicable labour and environmental laws. This allows us to select
suppliers to work with us who adhere to appropriate standards.
Detailed financial analysis and assessment of suppliers, reputations and experience is carried out.
We also seek to identify if our suppliers operate a vendor management programme and carry out
due diligence on their own suppliers to ensure that appropriate standards are being passed through
the supply chain.
Our suppliers are required to notify us of a breach of applicable laws or regulations and outline their
practices and procedures to ensure they do not engage in modern slavery (including their own
supply chain). This includes monitoring the content of modern slavery and human trafficking
statements published by our suppliers and completing additional assurance activity when we visit
our supplier sites.
Training and Awareness
Bank of Ireland Group is focused on raising awareness of the policies listed above with colleagues across

the organisation. This includes the provision of mandatory training for employees on the Group Code of
Conduct and Speak Up Policy each year.
Our managers also receive further support that includes training and line management guidance to
ensure consistency of our recruitment processes, management of suppliers, fair treatment at work, and
inclusion and diversity.
Court of Directors Approval
Responsibility for ensuring that the Group has appropriate policies in place to meet our obligations
under the Modern Slavery Act rests with the Court of Directors.
This Statement has been approved by the Court of Directors on 7 April 2020, and will be reviewed
annually.

Disclosure Statement
Church & Dwight's products have been a standard of quality and environmental
responsibility since 1846. We are a global consumer products group. Church &
Dwight Co., Inc., is the parent company of a number of companies spread across
the globe, including Church & Dwight UK Ltd. Together with Church & Dwight Co.,
Inc., these companies make up the Church & Dwight group or ""Church & Dwight"".
More information about the company, its structure and its operations are available
here.

We are committed to conducting our global operations in a responsible manner and expect the same commitment
from our suppliers. Combatting modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and our supply chain is,
therefore, important. The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 and the UK's Modern Slavery Act
of 2015 require manufacturers and retailers doing business in California and/or the UK to disclose their efforts to
eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains. Church & Dwight's efforts include the
following:
1. Our Guiding Principles. As part of our Responsible Sourcing Program, all of our suppliers are expected to
abide by the Church & Dwight Co., Inc. Global Operations Guiding Principles (""Guiding Principles"") which set
out minimum standards for working conditions that are safe and afford workers respect and dignity. The
Guiding Principles were developed based on the principles of internationally recognized human rights and
labor conditions and reflect our commitment to sustainable operations. They are substantially aligned with
the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights, the International Labor Organization's 1998 Declaration on
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the Labor Principles of the United Nations Global Compact.
They are also substantially aligned with the Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code. The Employment Standards
within the Guiding Principles provide that ""employees must be employed of their own free will,"" suppliers are
not permitted to utilize ""forced labor in any form,"" may not utilize corporal punishment as a form of discipline,
and must pay employees wages required by law. The Guiding Principles also prohibit vendors from engaging
in or supporting ""trafficking of individuals"" and require vendors to have ""appropriate systems in place to
ensure compliance with slavery and human trafficking laws.""
2. Our Supplier Contracts. Our supplier contracts require suppliers to conduct their operations in accordance
with all applicable laws and the Guiding Principles. In addition, consistent with the Guiding Principles, our
supplier contracts include a forced labor warranty which requires suppliers to warrant that they do not
employ ""prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor or use corporal or other forms of mental and physical
coercion as a form of discipline"" and that they ""will not conduct business with vendors employing...prison
labor, indentured labor, bonded labor or who use corporal punishment or other forms of mental and physical
coercion as a form of discipline.""
3. Supplier Qualification. In 2018, we launched a program to assess supplier risk and pre-qualify new
suppliers against the standards set forth in the Guiding Principles, including the prohibition on forced labor
and trafficking. Church & Dwight is engaging a third-party auditor to perform the verification process with

and trafficking. Church & Dwight is engaging a third-party auditor to perform the verification process with
certain higher potential risk new and existing suppliers in order to monitor and assess risk in our supply
chains.
4. Our Audit Program. In 2018 we launched a comprehensive audit program using independent audit firms
which will be used to hold our suppliers accountable to the standards set forth in the Guiding Principles. We
conduct comprehensive social audits of certain of our higher potential risk suppliers. The audit program is
being implemented as a semi-announced audit program pursuant to which the factory to be audited is given
an agreed upon window during which the auditors may arrive at any time unannounced.
5. Our Audit Standards. The structure of an audit will generally follow Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit
(SMETA) Best Practice Guidance. In order to clearly identify high-risk suppliers within our supply chain
where there is an increased risk of modern slavery, we will, among other factors, utilize our independent
audit firm's proprietary Risk Map, which includes, among other proprietary and non-proprietary data, audit
reports, surveys, trends and statistics, World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators; the US State
Department Human Trafficking Report; and the US Department of Labor Forced Labor List.
6. Violations Response. Any supplier found to be in violation of the Guiding Principles will be subject to
corrective action, which may include termination of business.
7. Training. Church & Dwight requires all of its employees and management to abide by our Code of Conduct.
Our Code of Conduct requires that we maintain the highest ethical standards and never take unfair
advantage of anyone. It was designed to encourage a culture of honesty, accountability and mutual respect;
to provide guidance to help personnel recognize and deal with ethical issues; and to provide a reporting
mechanism for company personnel to report unethical conduct. Existing and new employees (including but
not limited to relevant management-level personnel) directly involved in procurement, supply chain and other
relevant functions have receive specific training regarding our Responsible Sourcing Program, which is
designed to combat modern slavery and human trafficking, and many of them have been involved in
designing our Responsible Sourcing Program that includes all of the elements set forth in this Policy and
they are familiar with the details of our Responsible Sourcing Program. That training program supplements
training that is provided to all employees with respect to our Code of Conduct that applies to all employees
and directors and that require compliance with applicable laws, including those prohibiting slavery and
human trafficking.
8. Addressing Violations. Church & Dwight's policy against human trafficking and slavery is included in the
Guiding Principles. Any violation of applicable laws, our Code of Conduct, Company policies or the Guiding
Principles by a Church & Dwight employee, including violations of laws and policies regarding slavery and
human trafficking, may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment, in
accordance with applicable law.
9. Reporting Concerns. To report a concern, talk to your Church & Dwight representative. If you prefer to
remain anonymous, you may go to www.churchdwight.ethicspoint.com or call the Church & Dwight Hotline at
one of the toll-free telephone numbers available here; both the web site and telephone numbers are
administered by an independent third party.
10. Oversight. In 2016, Church & Dwight established our Corporate Issues Council. The Council is comprised of
Church & Dwight senior executives and other leaders representing functional areas across the enterprise.
The Council takes the lead in defining and implementing our sustainability strategies concerning human
rights and labor conditions in our operations and supply chain, among other things. The Council, which
meets quarterly, monitors adherence to our Global Principles. Concerns can also be reported as set forth
above. Our Board of Directors, through its Governance & Nominating Committee oversees our sustainability
program.
Church & Dwight will continue to review its policies and procedures to make sure we have appropriate safeguards
in place to protect persons employed in bringing out products to our consumers.
This statement is made pursuant to The California Transparency in Supply Chain Act of 2010 (SB 657) and section
54(1) of the UK's Modern Slavery Act of 2015 and constitutes the Church & Dwight group's slavery and human
trafficking statement for the fiscal year ending 2018.

Compliance

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 became
effective in California on January 1, 2012, and the UK Modern
Slavery Act became effective in the UK on March 26, 2015.
These laws were each designed to increase the amount of information manufacturers and
retailers make available to customers and consumers regarding their efforts to address the
issue of slavery and human trafficking.
As is stated in the Cummins Code of Business Conduct:
""Customers, employees, shareholders and communities have depended on Cummins to do the
right thing for almost 100 years. Our Company’s strong ethical reputation and business success
have been built on doing what is right and doing what we say we will do. That is why integrity is
one of our Company’s core values. . . . Our Code of Business Conduct forms the backbone of
our commitment to ethical behavior.""
For more information, please see the Code of Business Conduct .
Cummins has a comprehensive Code of Business Conduct which includes provisions prohibiting
forced or child labor. We require all employees to comply with, and have training on, the
Cummins Code of Business Conduct. Included in our Code of Business Conduct is the following
language:
""...We support human rights around the world, and will comply with all applicable laws regarding
the treatment of our employees and other stakeholders. We will not tolerate child or forced

the treatment of our employees and other stakeholders. We will not tolerate child or forced
labor anywhere and we will not do business with any company that does. . . . Our
commitment to fair treatment also extends to our joint ventures, suppliers and other partners...""
Through our Supplier Code of Conduct, we make sure our suppliers and partners understand
our values and treat their stakeholders in a way that is consistent with those values. The
Supplier Code of Conduct provides, in pertinent part, as follows:

NO FORCED LABOR, NO CHILD LABOR
Suppliers must not use slavery or involuntary labor of any kind, including prison labor, debt
bondage, or forced labor by governments and suppliers must not be involved in human
trafficking. Suppliers must not use corporal punishment, physical or psychological abuse,
threats or violence, or other forms of physical or mental coercion. There must not be
unreasonable restrictions on the ability of employees to enter or exit the workplace.”

SPECIFIC CALIFORNIA DISCLOSURES:
Verification of Product Supply Chain . Cummins suppliers are required to sign a response form
(“SCOC Response Form”) agreeing to comply with the Supplier Code of Conduct (“SCOC”), which
includes a prohibition against forced or child labor, or affirmatively set forth the reasons why
they are unable to comply. Cummins reviews the SCOC Response Form to ensure that it meets
the intent of the SCOC. If Cummins concludes that the supplier is not in compliance based on
the SCOC Response Form, Cummins will work with the supplier to (a) develop a plan to attain
compliance, or (b) work on an exit strategy. If the Supplier agrees to take the appropriate steps
to comply, Cummins will monitor the supplier’s actions until all those required have been taken.
Supplier Audits . To verify that suppliers remain in compliance with SCOC, Cummins conducts an
audit during supplier visits in China, India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa and Eastern European
countries (including Russia). The informal audit is conducted by Cummins personnel and the
supplier is not notified before or during the audit. Cummins management will contact the
supplier’s management to inform them of all negative audit scores and Cummins will develop a
corrective action plan with the supplier. If any inappropriate behaviors or conditions viewed as
systemic or critical are observed during the audit, the situation is reviewed with the Cummins
legal department for appropriate action.
Supplier Agreements . Cummins requires suppliers that make up the top 80% of purchases to
sign an SCOC Response Form or a contract that contains SCOC language, which requires
suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations and includes the prohibition against
the use of forced or child labor of any kind.
Accountability Standards and Procedures . As our Code of Business Conduct states, “. . . [w]e
will not tolerate child or forced labor anywhere and we will not do business with any company
that does. . . .” Employees and contractors have multiple avenues to raise concerns should a
fellow employee or contractor be suspected to be in violation of this core ethical principal.
These avenues include contacting their supervisor, human resources or calling the ethics
helpline or report through a specially designed ethics website. Cummins does not tolerate
retaliation and no action will be taken against an employee or contractor because he or she
reported a concern.

Similarly, Cummins SCOC sets forth our expectations for suppliers. An employee or contractor
who identifies a potential violation of the SCOC (outside of the Supplier Audit context described
above) should report the information to his or her management, the purchasing department or
the legal function so that Cummins can investigate the matter and take appropriate action.
Supply Chain Training . Cummins trains employees responsible for supply chain management
on Corporate Responsibility. We require all Cummins employees to comply with, and have
training on, the Cummins Code of Business Conduct, which includes provisions prohibiting
forced or child labor.
Due diligence processes for slavery and human trafficking
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk we have in place systems to:
• Identify and assess potential risk areas when considering taking on new suppliers and
regularly review our existing supply chains.
• Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our supply chains.
• Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains.
• Protect whistle blowers.
Training
We have zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking. To maintain awareness and ensure a
high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our
businesses our Code of Business Conduct is available on the Intranet.

SPECIFIC UNITED KINGDOM DISCLOSURES:
Structure and Supply Chains
Cummins’ UK presence is comprised of four manufacturing sites and an additional 14
associated sites which includes parts reconditioning, distribution and administration. We
employ approximately 5000 employees in the UK. In 2019, Cummins imported approximately
£1.6B of parts and materials into the UK, of which approximately 30% was imported from the EU.
Of all Cummins’ global imports into the UK, approximately 45% were imported directly from
Cummins Inc. or a Cummins affiliate.
Policies on Modern Slavery
In March 2018, Cummins launched its Human Rights policy which applies to Cummins entities
worldwide. The policy prohibits the use of all forms of child labor and forced labor, including
threat of force or penalty, prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor, military labor, slave
labor and any form of human trafficking.
Cummins’ Human Rights policy and our Code of Business Conduct reflect and further detail our
company’s commitment to human rights. In our Code of Business Conduct, Cummins states:
“We will embrace diverse perspectives and backgrounds, and treat all people with dignity and
respect.” Our Code further states:
“We support human rights around the world, and will comply with all applicable laws regarding
the treatment of our employees and other stakeholders. We will not tolerate child or forced
labor anywhere and we will not do business with any company that does (. . .) Our commitment
to fair treatment and human rights also extends to our joint ventures, suppliers and other
partners. We will insist our suppliers and partners treat their stakeholders in a way that is
consistent with our values through our Supplier Code of Conduct.”

consistent with our values through our Supplier Code of Conduct.”
Additionally, through our Supplier Code of Conduct, we ensure our suppliers and partners
understand our values and treat their employees and business partners in a way that is
consistent with those values. The Supplier Code of Conduct states:
“Suppliers must not use slavery or involuntary labor of any kind, including prison labor, debt
bondage, or forced labor by governments and suppliers must not be involved in human
trafficking. Suppliers must not use corporal punishment, physical or psychological abuse,
threats or violence, or other forms of physical or mental coercion. There must not be
unreasonable restrictions on the ability of employees to enter or exit the workplace.”
Due Diligence Processes and Risk Assessment
Due to the nature of Cummins business and based on the industry that Cummins operates in,
our analysis determined that there is low risk of human-rights violations. Nonetheless, we have
initiated processes to identify and combat such risks within our supply chain. In 2019, Cummins
took steps to assess and mitigate human-rights risks within our supply chain with a focus on
suppliers we engage in our UK business. These steps include:
Identification of UK-based suppliers that may pose human-rights related risks (targeted
suppliers). Based on our risk-based assessment, these include suppliers that provide laborrelated services to Cummins’ entities located in the UK. Examples include but are not limited to:
catering, cleaning, security and logistics services.
Cummins expects all suppliers, including targeted suppliers, to comply with the Cummins
Supplier Code of Conduct.
In addition to selected suppliers that make up top 80% of Cummins’ purchases, targeted
suppliers have been included as part of supplier annual review to ensure compliance with the
Cummins Supplier Code of Conduct since 2019.
Measuring Effectiveness
Cummins measures its effectiveness by confirming that the targeted suppliers certify
compliance with the Cummins Supplier Code of Conduct.
Cummins conducts informal audits of suppliers on a global basis including suppliers in the UK
and mainland European countries, to verify that suppliers remain in compliance with the
Cummins Supplier Code of Conduct.
Cummins will continuously improve by evaluating processes to identify suppliers which present
human rights violation risks.
Training for Staff
In addition to classroom and online training of Cummins Code of Business Conduct to all
Cummins employees globally, Cummins launched online training on the Human Rights policy to
specific employee audiences such as purchasing, logistics and, manufacturing functions in
2019.
This statement is (i) made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and
constitutes our company’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending
31st December 2019 and (ii) approved and signed by relevant directors of Cummins Ltd.,
Cummins Power Generation Limited and Cummins Generator Technologies Limited on 30 March
2020.

Code of Business Conduct
Employees are required to abide by H.B. Fuller’s Code of Business Conduct.

Supply Chain Transparency
H.B. Fuller Company does not knowingly purchase goods or services produced using forced labor, child labor or in violation of
any applicable local labor laws. Our standard purchase order requires that our suppliers comply with all applicable Federal,
State or Local Laws, Rules, Regulations, Ordinances and Executive Orders. Employees are required to abide by H.B. Fuller’s
Code of Business Conduct.
Supplier Expectations Letter

Conflict Minerals Policy
This document contains H.B. Fuller’s statement regarding the use of conflict minerals in our products. As used in this policy,
“H.B. Fuller” includes H.B. Fuller Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries, as applicable, unless otherwise noted.
Regulatory Background
On August 22nd, 2012, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) adopted a final rule pursuant to
Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Conflict Minerals Rule”). The
Conflict Minerals Rule is intended to reduce a significant source of funding for armed groups that are committing human rights
abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo (the “DRC”) and its adjoining countries.
Under the Conflict Minerals Rule, to the extent that “conflict minerals” are necessary to the functionality or production of
products that H.B. Fuller manufactures or contracts to manufacture (the “Covered Products”), the SEC requires H.B. Fuller to
conduct supply chain due diligence to determine whether the conflict minerals originated in the DRC or one of its adjoining
countries. The DRC and its adjoining countries are collectively referred to under the rule as “covered countries.” In addition to
the DRC, the covered countries include: Angola; Burundi; Central African Republic; the Republic of the Congo; Rwanda; South
Sudan; Tanzania; Uganda; and Zambia. The minerals (and derivative metals) covered by the Conflict Mineral Rule include:
Cassiterite (Tin); Columbite-tantalite (Tantalum); Wolframite (Tungsten); and Gold. The Conflict Minerals Rule defines these
minerals (sometimes referred to as “three Ts and gold” or “3TG”) as “conflict minerals,” regardless of their country of origin.
Publicly traded companies must report annually to the SEC the presence of conflict minerals originating in the DRC and its
adjoining countries in products that they manufacture or contract to manufacture if those conflict minerals are necessary to

the functionality or production of the products.
H.B. Fuller’s Policy with regard to the Conflict Minerals Rule
H.B. Fuller Company is committed to ethical practices and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including SEC
regulations and the Conflict Minerals Rule. As a public company that manufactures or contracts to manufacture products that
may contain conflict minerals, H.B. Fuller is working with its suppliers to determine whether the conflict minerals in its
products originated from a covered country and if so, to determine if it is a source of funding for armed groups. We recognize
that there may be multiple layers in the supply chain between our suppliers and the smelter of the conflict minerals that are in
or may be in the goods that are supplied. Most of our products are not Covered Products, but for the small number that are, we
do not generally source conflict minerals directly from the source of supply (mines, smelters, refiners). Therefore, we are
generally removed by several levels from the ultimate source of conflict minerals. Because of this, we will use reasonable due
diligence to identify the source of the conflict minerals, realizing that this will require the cooperation of our suppliers to meet
our compliance obligations.
H.B. Fuller does not knowingly support any action which provides funding, or any form of support, for armed groups that are
committing human rights abuses in the DRC and its adjoining countries. Our goal is to comply with the Conflict Minerals Rule
and continually gain more transparency in our supply chain. We recognize that, due to the complexity of our supply chain, this
goal will take time and effort. To comply with the requirements of the Conflict Minerals Rule, we will: understand the Conflict
Minerals Rule and its background;
communicate and educate our personnel, suppliers and customers regarding the Conflict Minerals Rule and we will urge our
suppliers to establish policies to ensure that any conflict minerals used in our products are conflict-free and to comply with
this rule and provide all necessary declarations; create processes and procedures to conduct a reasonable level of supply
chain due diligence and to comply with applicable SEC reporting requirements; and endeavor efforts to source from conflictfree suppliers. H.B. Fuller values its supplier and customer relationships. H.B. Fuller is initially focusing most of its efforts on
its most significant top-tier suppliers of goods that contain conflict minerals, and over time expects to extend that focus to
small suppliers deeper in the supply chain. Suppliers who are materially non-compliant will be reviewed by our sourcing
managers for future business.
This policy will be reviewed and revised from time to time, as needed.
Last revised: May 30, 2014

Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
H.B. Fuller Company is committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chain or in
any part of our business. Our Code of Business Conduct, which includes our Fair Treatment Core Policy, reflects our
commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships. As part of this commitment, we continue to
review and aim to implement effective systems and controls.
We recently updated our Conditions of Purchase, through which we do business with our suppliers, to make clearer our
position on modern slavery and human trafficking and other ethical/compliance requirements. We further emphasize this
stance within a Supplier Expectations letter, also recently updated, which specifically forms part of all new supplier contracts
so far as we are able to negotiate this with suppliers. To promote and to allow suppliers easier access to these expectations,
this year we also rolled out a new ‘Supplier page’ on our publicly available website: https://www.hbfuller.com/suppliers.
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain and our
business, we have provided training to our employees and will continue to do so in the future. Next year we hope to refresh
and refine our training to ensure that it is most effective. To this end, we will work further with our Sourcing group to identify,
assess and monitor potential risk areas across our supply chain. We will review our due diligence and ongoing assessment of
suppliers.
Our HBF Path Employee Helpline process is a channel through which we aim to protect and support reporting and whistle
blowing by our employees. We might consider expanding access to our Helpline to other individuals in order to enhance
potential reporting of noncompliance with our Code of Business Conduct.
Our goal for next year is to deliver improvements on our ongoing assessment of risk areas in our supply chain, and to ensure

that the H.B. Fuller wider group around the world, including more recently acquired businesses, is consistent in its approach.
Our work with the Sourcing group will be a key part of this drive towards delivering improvements.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes H.B. Fuller Company’s
slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending December 3, 2020.

Health & Safety
TPI recognizes that safe and healthy work environments are essential to the morale of our employees and their
ability to consistently produce high quality products and services. We regularly audit our facilities to identify and
eliminate hazardous materials and potentially dangerous situations. Where environmental hazards and
physically demanding work cannot be eliminated, employees are provided with protective equipment,
specialized training and work aids to allow them to perform this work with minimal risk to themselves and other
employees. Performance in these areas is reviewed monthly at the company level.

Environmental
We comply with all environmental permit and reporting requirements in all of our manufacturing facilities. We
have global and local programs dedicated to waste reduction and elimination. We regularly work with
customers and vendors to identify environmentally sound solutions to business problems.

Conflict Minerals
We do not knowingly use materials containing any substance derived from the eﬀorts of armed groups that are
perpetrators of serious human rights violations in any country in the world. This speciﬁcally includes activities in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo that produce materials known as ""conﬂict minerals"" or any other material
produced using any form of forced or coerced labor. We periodically undertake survey eﬀorts to ascertain the
source of new or recycled minerals and metals to ensure compliance with this policy.

Ethics
Toppan Photomasks employees are held to the highest standards of ethical behavior. We do not support or
condone bribery or any other business practice that might create an improper advantage. We report all ﬁnancial
and business performance information accurately and in full accord with all applicable local and international
laws, regulations and industry practices. We protect the storage, processing and sharing of the personal
information of our employees and the trade secrets of our customers.
TPI informs all employees of its expectations regarding corporate social responsibility, measures compliance at
least annually, and encourages employee participation in programs supporting it. All employees are encouraged
to identify events or behaviors that do not meet our standards, and we provide multiple methods, including
anonymous means, for doing so with EthicsPoint. We protect any employee raising a concern about our actions
from any form of retribution. We encourage our vendors to adopt the same expectations for their own
organizations.

Disclosure under the California Transparency in Supply
Chains Act of 2010
Eﬀective January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires retailers and
manufacturers doing business in California to disclose eﬀorts to eradicate slavery and human traﬃcking from its
direct supply chain. The following is Toppan Photomasks, Inc.'s required disclosure under the Act.
As stated in its Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Toppan Photomasks is committed to conducting
business in accordance with the highest ethical and legal standards. Toppan Photomasks expects that its
suppliers will conduct their business not only in a lawful manner but also in compliance with the same high
standards of integrity and ethics that apply to Toppan Photomasks. At this point, Toppan Photomasks does not
engage in independent veriﬁcation of product supply chains to evaluate or address the risks of human
traﬃcking and slavery, audit suppliers to evaluate compliance with our standards for human traﬃcking and
slavery in supply chains, nor require suppliers to certify that the materials incorporated into their products
comply with laws regarding human traﬃcking and slavery. Toppan Photomasks maintains internal accountability
standards and procedures applicable to both employees and contractors who may fail to meet company
standards, and requires its employees to annually certify compliance with our code of ethics, but does not
provide separate standards, procedures or training regarding human traﬃcking and slavery.

Slavery and human trafficking statement

Ensuring human rights are respected is fundamental to our core
purpose and integral to how we as a business wish to operate. Our
public policies concerning human rights clearly articulate the high
standards we hold ourselves to and the expectations we have of our
suppliers and partners that include freedom from slavery and human
trafficking. We do not tolerate slave or trafficked labour and will
remediate any violations promptly by collaborating transparently with
all appropriate stakeholders.

Rakesh Kapoor

Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC (RB) is the
world’s leading consumer health and
hygiene company. We have operations in
over 60 countries, with headquarters in
London, Dubai and Amsterdam, and sales
in most countries across the world. The
company employs approximately 37,000
people globally. RB is in the top 10
companies listed on the London
Stock Exchange.

Our organisational
structure, business
and supply chain

We have a truly global supply chain, sourcing from 47 of our own
manufacturing facilities and a range of suppliers, who provide us with
everything from raw and packaging materials and finished goods,
through to logistics, warehousing, office services and supplies. Some of
our suppliers are large, multinational companies with substantial
business and ethical conduct programmes of their own. Smaller, local
companies – for example within our Development Markets (DvM) area
– may not operate such formal conduct programmes, but can still be
excellent suppliers. Our suppliers are chosen based on quality, cost,
location and compliance to our policies and standards, including our
Policy on Human Rights and Responsible Business, which includes a
requirement of no slavery or human trafficking.

Our policies relating to
slavery and human
trafficking

RB believes that human rights, which
includes freedom from slavery and human
trafficking, are an absolute and universal
requirement and as such are committed to
upholding those rights as expressed in the
International Bill of Human Rights and the
International Labour Organisation’s (ILO)
Declaration on Fundamental Principles and
Rights at Work. We are also committed to
following the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development’s (OECD’s)
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.

We recognise the important role businesses play in society and the
responsibility we have in helping to ensure human rights are respected.
Our commitment to respecting human rights is publicly disclosed
through our Policy on Human Rights and Responsible Business, which
was developed using a range of internal and external expertise and
was influenced by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights (UNGPs), legislative requirements such as those outlined by this
Act, industry best practice and through consultation with peers. This
policy applies to all employees, contractors and suppliers of goods and
services to RB, and we encourage our suppliers to communicate our
requirements within their supply chain. At the start of any commercial
relationship, we communicate our requirements to suppliers and
integrate the need for them to comply within the commercial contract.
Read our Policy on Human Rights and
Responsible Business here

Reckitt Benckiser Group plc (RB)
Slavery and human trafficking statement

The Executive Vice President of Supply and Senior Vice President
of Human Resources are the owners of our Policy on Human
Rights and Responsible Business. The Chief Safety, Quality and
Compliance Officer, reporting directly to the CEO, is responsible
for ensuring the policy remains current and compliance is
monitored across our operations and high-risk supplier base
through our compliance-monitoring programme. At an
operational level, it is the responsibility of every employee within
the business to ensure compliance and support our compliance
programme. Any breaches of these policies can be confidentially
reported through our internal Whistleblower hotline. Board level
oversight is provided by the Corporate Responsibility,
Sustainability, Ethics and Compliance Committee, who review,
monitor and assess our approach to responsible, sustainable,
ethical and compliant corporate conduct.

We do not accept any human rights violations within our own
operations and supply chain. If we cause or contribute to any such
impact, we will co-operate in, or provide for, appropriate and
legitimate processes to remedy it. We recognise the complexity of
human rights issues and the limitations on what we are able to control
and influence; therefore, our approach to remediation focuses on
stakeholder collaboration and transparency. We believe the best
resolution in the interest of improving practices is to work with our
supply chain to resolve issues rather than immediately terminating
business relationships. However, should we believe a party is not
providing appropriate support to remedy issues, we will immediately
terminate our business relationship with them.
We also have a specific standard for the responsible sourcing of natural
raw materials, which outlines the need to source raw materials in a way
that goes beyond applicable laws and regulations, that respects human
rights, safeguards health & safety, protects the environment and
generally supports the contribution of business to achieving
sustainable development.

Due-diligence relating
to slavery and human
trafficking

Our due diligence processes within our organisation
and supply chain
We believe that policies alone are not sufficient in ensuring compliance.
Consequently, we have established a proactive compliance monitoring
programme focused on continuous improvement to enable us to
identify and remediate any deviations from our policy within our
business and supply chain. The programme is integrated within the
business at all levels and has cross-functional involvement from our
global sustainability, procurement, manufacturing, human resources,
legal and internal audit teams. The programme is reviewed regularly
by our senior leadership team, who participate in and steer our
long-term strategy and targets.

Human Rights due-diligence for our internal operations
Risk of slavery and human trafficking within
our business and supply chain
We have reviewed our direct supplier base to determine which areas
are at greatest risk from a labour, (including slavery and human
trafficking), health & safety, environmental and business integrity
perspective. This process was conducted using internal and external
expertise, with consideration given to a range of factors that included
country of operation, commodity supplied and sector profile. Through
this process, the following supplier groups were identified as being
high risk and in need of further due-diligence: third-party
manufacturers, distribution centres and selected raw and packaging
material suppliers, predominantly located within our Developing
Markets area - Latin America, Middle East, Africa, North and South
Asia. We have already commenced due diligence of our operations and
supply chain across these supplier groups and geographies, which will
continue in 2017.

All our manufacturing facilities and distribution centres are included
in our compliance programme and are required to complete an annual
self-assessment, with those identified as being high-risk undergoing an
unannounced audit. In 2016, we audited 13 of our 31 facilities located

in high-risk geographies, identifying 130 non-conformances with our
requirements. The three most common issues identified concerned
health & safety (68%), working hours (10%) and remuneration (9%).
We promptly remediate any areas of non-compliances and have
internal processes to monitor progress. In 2016, 84% of the issues
raised were satisfactorily resolved with action plans in place for the
remaining issues.
In 2016, we identified two non-compliances with our ‘No forced
labour’ clause at our facility in Bahrain. The issues concerned the
withholding of passports without the consent of sub-contracted
labour provided by a third party. We identified this through an internal
review and immediately remediated the case. This is a common and
challenging issue faced by companies operating within the Middle East.
Therefore in 2017, we shall be conducting further due diligence of
not just our manufacturing facilities, but also offices located within
this region.

Due-diligence relating
to slavery and human
trafficking (continued)

Human rights due-diligence for our supply chain
To ensure a comprehensive but efficient approach to managing risks in
our supply chain, we take a risk-based approach to conducting
due-diligence, ensuring our resources are effectively deployed to the
areas of highest risk. We are currently focusing on high-risk direct
suppliers (all third-party manufacturers and selected packaging and
raw material suppliers predominantly located within developing
markets) and distribution centres located in developing markets.

2,921
862

direct suppliers and
distribution centers

high-risk direct suppliers and
distribution centers included
in compliance programme

We currently have 862 suppliers included in the programme,
amounting to 913 individual sites, of which 84% have completed a
self-assessment. Once in the programme, we conduct a site level risk
assessment to determine which sites require an on-site audit. Since
initiating our supply chain audit programme at the end of 2013, we
have conducted 126 audits, the majority of which were at third party
manufacturers located in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, South
and North Asia. Through our supply chain audits, we have identified
1,349 non-compliances with our requirements, the majority of issues
concerning health & safety (54%), working hours & remuneration
(21%), management systems (9%) and environment (7%). Our
procurement and sustainability teams directly engage with suppliers to
ensure the closure of all issues within appropriate timescales. Of the
issues identified, 82% are closed, and we will continue to work with
suppliers to close those remaining. No specific incidents of child or
forced labour have been identified; however, issues were raised within
these areas regarding the absence of policies and processes, which we
have worked with our suppliers to develop and implement.

Palm oil
Given the increasing environmental and social concern within the
palm oil industry, in 2014 we initiated a palm oil traceability
programme in partnership with The Forest Trust.

The focus of this programme was to trace the palm oil derivatives
we procure back through the supply chain - from supplier to
refinery, and subsequently from refinery to mill. In 2015, we
achieved traceability to mill for 70% of our palm oil volumes
(excluding surfactants). In addition, we conducted on-the-ground
compliance assessments at selected mills for all key suppliers. In
2016, we recognised the need to better understand the specific
human rights risks linked to palm oil mills and plantations. For
this reason, we shall increase our human rights due diligence by
enlisting the help of a specialist consultancy to support further
assessments focused on human rights within our palm oil
supply chain.

programme, see our approach and next steps

Continual improvement

Employees
We have developed mandatory eLearning on our human rights
requirements and associated compliance programme for relevant
functions and roles involved in supply chain management, of
which 85% have completed the training. Our target for 2017 is for
all employees to complete appropriate human rights training.

Assessment of effectiveness in
preventing modern slavery
We recognise that the human rights debate is a continually evolving
one. As such, our approach must be regularly reviewed and updated
so that it remains effective. The measures described above provide
critical evidence to ensure that we do not have slavery or trafficking
across our business and supply chains, and that we have developed
supporting internal KPIs for training, audits, reviews and closure
of non-conformances.
In 2016, we conducted a review against the UNGPs and identified
opportunities to further improve our due diligence and remediation
processes. Therefore, in 2017 our plans include:

Training and capability building

Suppliers

Raising awareness and understanding of human rights among our
people and suppliers plays a crucial part in preventing, identifying and
remediating human rights issues. We have implemented a number of
initiatives that increase awareness and understanding of human rights
and slavery for both our employees and suppliers.

We are members of AIM-Progress, a forum of leading FMCG
companies that enable and promote responsible sourcing
practices and sustainable supply chains. We actively participate in
supplier workshops organised by AIM-Progress and conduct our
own workshops to raise awareness and understanding of our
human rights requirements within our supply chain. Since 2013,
key suppliers and functions involved in supply chain management
have attended events in Dubai, India, Mexico, China and Thailand.
In 2016, we co-sponsored and actively participated in the
AIM-Progress supplier conference in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Learn more about AIM-Progress here

• Improving oversight of human rights management through our
recently established Safety, Quality and Compliance (SQC) function
and the Corporate Responsibility, Sustainability, Ethics and
Compliance (CRSEC) Board Committee.
• Establishing internal regional compliance resources to work
collaboratively with, and audit where necessary, all third-party
manufacturers and distribution centres within South Asia, Middle
East and Africa to improve oversight and compliance.
• Establishing a partner to externally review and audit our high-risk
direct suppliers.
• Undertaking further due-diligence of our operations within the
Middle East.
• Continuing proactive engagement with suppliers through physical
supplier workshops conducted in partnership with AIM-Progress
or independently.
• Requiring all employees to complete compulsory training on
human rights to raise awareness of the risks and how they
should be managed.
• Reviewing options for how we can improve our supplier grievance
mechanisms to implement plans in 2018.
We have made good progress and our plans for 2017 will deliver an
important step change in ensuring we do not have slavery and
trafficking in our operations and supply chain, providing a solid
foundation for continually reviewing and improving our approach to
human rights as needed.

the fiscal year ended March 2016
This statement is made pursuant to the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act of 2015. Nikon
Corporation endeavours to ensure that there are no human rights violations related to our own
operations, our supply chain and our products. We hereby provide disclosure concerning our
activities to prevent and tackle slavery and human trafficking.

a. Overview of the company, business and supply chain

Details of our company and business information can be found on the following website:
URL：http://www.nikon.com/about/info/index.htm
Most of our products sold in the U.K. market are through our group companies. However, some of
our products are sold directly from Nikon Corporation to the U.K. market.
Product parts and a small portion of the final products are supplied from external procurement
partners in and outside of Japan. There are approximately 1,700 procurement partners as of March
2016. More than ninety percent of the procurement partners are based in Japan, China and Thailand
(calculated by the number of companies and in which country their headquarters are located).

b. Policies related to modern slavery and human trafficking

We have established “Nikon Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Charter” which addresses our
group’s basic stance on our social responsibility, including ‘Respect for human beings’ and ‘Socially
responsible behaviour within the supply chain’. We demonstrate our commitment to respect human
rights in our business as well as in our supply chain. To enable every single employee to apply this
Charter in daily activities, we outline the standards of how we act ethically, with integrity and in
compliance with relevant laws and regulations in the Nikon Code of Conduct. In the Code, we state
that we do not tolerate forced or child labour and we request our procurement partners to comply
with our standards.
The Nikon CSR Charter can be found on the Nikon Sustainability Report 2016 (p.16):
http://www.nikon.com/about/sustainability/report/2016/sr2016_all.pdf#page=17
The Nikon Code of Conduct can be found on the Nikon Sustainability Report 2016 (p.47):
http://www.nikon.com/about/sustainability/report/2016/sr2016_all.pdf#page=48
As for our supply chain, we published in August 2015 “Nikon CSR Procurement Standards”, which is
the guideline to promote Nikon’s stance on CSR throughout our supply chain and we request our
procurement partners to comply with it. The Standards are based on the EICC (Electronics Industry
Citizenship Coalition) Code of Conduct, which is the global standard for the electronics industry and
articulates the prohibition of “forced, bonded (including debt bondage) or indentured labour,
involuntary prison labour, modern slavery or trafficking of persons”.
The Nikon CSR Procurement Standards can be found on the following website:
URL：http://www.nikon.com/about/info/procurement/csr.htm
In response to the issues of conflict minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo and its
neighboring countries, we set a policy of not using conflict minerals mined or intermediated by
armed forces violating human rights in the area, and have been conducting surveys in our supply
chain specifically on this issue.
Nikon’s Policy on Conflict Minerals can be found on the Nikon Sustainability Report 2016 (p.106):

c. Due diligence

Potential risk of modern slavery and human trafficking occurring is considered higher in our supply
chain than in our group companies. In Nikon group companies, we conduct human rights & labour
monitoring annually to ensure child and forced labour practices are not occurring. We will evaluate
and address risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain by enforcing the
Nikon CSR Procurement Standards with our procurement partners and by conducting periodic
monitoring.
In light of conflict mineral issues, we endeavour to prevent human rights violations such as modern
slavery and human trafficking from occurring by ensuring that conflict minerals are not used in our
products following our Policy on Conflict Minerals and by conducting investigations of our product
components.
More details can be found on the Nikon Sustainability Report 2016 (p.105):
http://www.nikon.com/about/sustainability/report/2016/sr2016_all.pdf#page=106

Establishment of Hotlines

For Nikon employees, we have hotline(s) per company (or per region) for them to be able to report
and/consult. As for our supply chain, Nikon CSR Procurement Standards state “Our Procurement
Partners should have a communicated process for their personnel to be able to raise any concerns
without fear of retaliation.” We will urge our procurement partners to set up such a mechanism
through our monitoring activities to check the compliance status of the Standards.
We established a Conflict Minerals Hotline in October 2015 in order to get reports from our
stakeholders, if there are acts contrary to the Nikon Policy on Conflict Minerals, or if it is a concern.
We investigate properly the information obtained through the Hotline and take corrective actions as
necessary.
More information about the Conflict Mineral Hotline can be found on the following website:
URL: https://www.uw.nikon.com/form/com/cmh/form.php

d. Risk assessment and risk management

In the fiscal year ended March 2016, we defined our business partner risk assessment criteria such
as location, business type, transaction volume, length of business partnership and type of contract.
Based on the assessment results, we conducted a self-assessment survey among 207 major 1st-tier
business partners to check the Nikon CSR Procurement Standards compliance status. We received a
response from all the surveyed companies. The answers to each question were weighed according to
potential risks and we created risk profiles after compiling all the response data.

e. Measurement by appropriate indicators and effectiveness

From the above mentioned risk assessment results, we identified three potentially high risk
companies and conducted on-site audits in these companies using third party auditors after advance
notification. These companies are all located in Asian countries. The results of the audits conducted
2

in February and March 2016 identified some concerns in the area of labour and ethics in these
companies and we requested rectification. Ten other companies where we did not conduct audits
but which had been identified as relatively high risk were instructed to make improvements in the
areas where the Nikon CSR Procurement Standards were not satisfied. We demanded that all 13
companies submit action plans and implement them after our approval. We are monitoring the
implementation and they are progressing according to the plans. Overall in the fiscal year ended
March 2016, we did not find any modern slavery and/or human trafficking issues.
The status and progress of the surveys, audits and improvement action plans are all reported to the
Nikon Corporation CSR Committee which includes Board members via the Supply Chain SubCommittee. The Supply Chain Sub-Committee is chaired by Corporate Vice President in charge of

We shall continue to disclose the details of our activity in relation to the Nikon CSR Procurement
Standards such as the number of companies conducting self-assessment and audits as progress
indicators.

f. Training and Capacity building

We explained modern slavery and human trafficking to the Supply Chain Sub-Committee when
Nikon CSR Procurement Standards were deliberated and approved.
In the fiscal year ending March 2016, we held internal briefing sessions for 160 personnel who are
responsible for product-related procurement in each business unit in Japan, China and Thailand.
They were trained on the contents of the Nikon CSR Procurement Standards and requested to
comply with them. We also provided two basic training sessions on procurement to 60 other
personnel who have purchasing activities in other functions, explaining Nikon’s stance on CSR and
the CSR Procurement Standards. In the next fiscal year, we will review the training contents to
enhance understanding of slavery and human trafficking risk.
As for our procurement partners, we held explanatory sessions on CSR Procurement Standards and
conflict minerals. Representing 897 1st-tier procurement partner companies, 1,223 people attended
the training sessions in Japan, China and Thailand. In the next fiscal year, we will endeavour to
improve the contents of the training aiming to deepen their understanding of modern slavery and
the human trafficking risk.

Nikon Group Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement for the fiscal year ended March 2020
This statement is made pursuant to the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act of 2015. The Nikon Group, Nikon Corporation and its
consolidated subsidiaries (“Nikon”, or “we”), endeavours to ensure that there are no human rights violations through our own
business operations or our supply chains. We hereby provide this disclosure statement regarding our activities to prevent and
tackle modern slavery and human trafficking.
a.Overview of the company, business and supply chain
Nikon has been engaged in various business fields, such as Imaging Products (digital cameras andinterchangeable lenses),
Precision Equipment (FPD lithography and Semiconductor lithography), Healthcare Equipment (microscope and retinal diagnostic
imaging equipment), and other businesses, based on the opto-electronic and precision technologies that Nikon has developed
since its establishment in 1917. Nikon manufactures and sells such equipment and apparatuses. Details of our company and
business information can be found on the “Corporate Information” page of the Nikon Corporation’s website.
Our business activities in the UK consist of product manufacturing, sales and/or services by our group companies: Nikon U.K.
Ltd., Optos plc, Nikon Metrology UK Ltd. and Nikon X-Tek Systems Ltd.
Nikon’s product parts and a small portion of the final products are supplied from external procurement partners, in and outside of
Japan. More than ninety percent (calculated by the transaction amount in the country in which their headquarters are located) of
procurement partners are based in Japan, China and Thailand.
b.Policies related to modern slavery and human trafficking
Nikon has the “Nikon Code of Conduct” (“Code”) in place where we set out our basic stance on socialresponsibility and the
standard of conduct for individuals who work for Nikon. The Code includes the sections of “Respect for Human Rights” and
“Social Responsibility in the Supply Chain”, where we clarify our stance against forced labour and child labour not only with
respect to Nikon, but also our suppliers and business partners. Furthermore, we launched our “Nikon Human Rights Policy”
(“Policy”) in April 2019 in order to further outline our approach to address human rights issues related to our business activities,
based on the Code. In the Policy, we identify seven issues as particularly relevant to our business that we commit to addressing,
including “Prohibition of Forced Labour and Child Labour” and “Working Hours and Wages”.
In May 2018, Nikon joined the worldwide CSR alliance “Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)”, whose members include
companies in the electronics, retail and auto industries. RBA’s code of conduct specifies responsibilities for member companies,
such as to improve working environment in supply chains or to support the rights and wellbeing of employees. Nikon strives to
comply with RBA’s code of conduct.
As for our supply chain, in August 2015 we published the “Nikon CSR Procurement Standards” (last revision: October 2018),
which is our guideline to promote Nikon’s stance on CSR throughout our supply chain, and we require our procurement partners
to comply with it. The Standards are based on the RBA’s code of conduct, which articulates the prohibition of “forced, bonded
(including debt bondage) or indentured labour, involuntary prison labour, slavery or trafficking of persons”.
In response to issues related to conflict minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo and its neighbouring countries, we
established the “Policy on Conflict Minerals”. The policy prohibits using conflict minerals mined or intermediated by armed forces
who violate human rights in the area. It also addresses our stance to endeavour not to engage in human rights violations
including modern slavery and human trafficking.
We also support the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact.
These group policies related to modern slavery and human trafficking are also applicable to our UK group companies listed
above.
c.Due diligence process related to modern slavery and human trafficking
d.Risk assessment and risk management related to modern slavery and human trafficking
e.Measurement by appropriate indicators and effectiveness of steps to endeavour to ensure that slavery and human
trafficking is not taking place
In our Human Rights Policy, we identify seven human rights issues as particularly relevant issues to our business, including
“Prohibition of Forced Labour and Child Labour”, “Occupational Health and Safety”, “Working Hours and Wages” and “Human
Rights Issues in the Supply Chain”. We seek to continually improve our approach to address these issues.
Within Nikon, we conduct human rights and labour monitoring surveys annually to ensure child and forced labour practices are

Within Nikon, we conduct human rights and labour monitoring surveys annually to ensure child and forced labour practices are
not occurring. For the fiscal year ended March 2020 (“Period”), at our manufacturing companies, we checked whether we had
migrant workers (or foreign technical trainees in Japan) under our employment. Through these checks we did not identify any
issues that may be considered as high risk
In addition to the above, in order to comply with RBA’s code of conduct, we responded to RBA’s self-assessment questionnaires
to check our risk level in eight manufacturing group companies outside Japan in the Period, following the previous year’s
assessment in Japan. We did not identify any issues of high risk.
For Nikon employees, we have internal as well as regional or local external hotline(s) by which they are able to report when they
become aware of an actual or potential violation of the Nikon Code of Conduct. Our employees can use the hotline(s)
anonymously.
In our supply chain, we request our procurement partners to comply with the Nikon CSR Procurement Standards, which is
explicitly mentioned in the basic transaction agreement. By conducting periodical monitoring of the compliance situation through
self-assessment survey, we endeavour to assess modern slavery and human trafficking risks in our supply chain. Moreover, we
set 65% compliance level of the CSR Procurement Standards as the minimum requirement, and have started to request the
partners to meet this requirement. We will provide support to those who do not reach the required level of compliance for a
certain period to make improvement. We may terminate the transaction in case they are not willing to cooperate.
We conducted self-assessment surveys for eight companies in the Period, mainly for new procurement partner selection.
As the above mentioned improvement support activities, out of about 600 companies, we selected 13 partners with the result of
compliance level less than 65% in the self-assessment for three years before the Period. We conducted on-site audits for three
partners by third-party auditors. And for the ten other companies, we instructed them in writing to make improvements in the
areas where the Nikon CSR Procurement Standards were not satisfied. We demanded that all 13 companies submit action plans
for our approval, and they are taking actions in accordance with such plans. Fourteen companies to which we requested
rectification by on-site audits or letters during the fiscal year ended March 2019 reported to us that they completed corrective
actions within the Period.
We will continue our efforts for improvement so that all our partners would meet the 65 % level.
In light of the growing attention on issues related to the working environment of migrant workers, we had examined two labour
recruiters who help provide our procurement partners with access to migrant workers since the previous period. These are both
Japanese companies who intermediate between Indonesian & Chinese workers and Japanese companies. We found that their
local recruitment fee practices were in breach of the Nikon CSR Procurement Standards. We requested the relevant procurement
partners for rectification.
In light of conflict mineral issues, we endeavour to prevent human rights violations, such as modern slavery and human trafficking,
through implementing our Policy on Conflict Minerals and conducting investigations
of our product components to ensure conflict minerals are not used. We had expanded the number of business units in the scope
of investigations year by year, and in the Period all business units were included in the scope. With expansion of the scope and
ensuring the continuation, we aim to achieve actual implementation and realisation of the policy.
Our UK group companies listed above are also participating in these efforts as members of the Nikon Group.
f.Training and Capacity building related to modern slavery and human trafficking
As mentioned above, Nikon launched the Human Rights Policy in April 2019. In the Period, we conductedthe training for all
directors and employees in Nikon group on the Human Rights Policy and issues relevant to our business. The training was carried
out in the way that would be appropriate to each company, including e-learning, classroom training or self-study. The completion
rate exceeded 90%.
For our supply chain, every year we explain the contents of the Nikon CSR Procurement Standards toemployees of our
procurement departments/sections and procurement partners. In the Period, we held explanatory sessions for our Supply Chain
Subcommittee, whose members include the Procurement and Quality Control department managers from each business unit.
Furthermore, briefing sessions were held in Japan, China and Thailand for procurement partners as well as our employees who
were responsible for procurement.
The agenda included international trends related to human rights issues in supply chains, such as the United Kingdom Modern
Slavery Act. In total, 66 employees and 965 procurement partners attended these briefings in the Period.
And we expand the target of training using tools/materials prepared by RBA in the Period; 33 employees in our procurement
departments/sections and 14 procurement partners participated in the RBA’s e-learning. The training contents are to facilitate

departments/sections and 14 procurement partners participated in the RBA’s e-learning. The training contents are to facilitate
understanding about the RBA’s code of conduct, including issues of human rights and labour practices.
This Statement was reviewed and approved by the Nikon Corporation’s Board of Directors on 8 September 2020.
Further, this Statement was reviewed and approved by Nikon U.K. Ltd.’s Board of Directors on 7 August 2020, Optos plc’s Board
of Directors on 27 August 2020, Nikon Metrology UK Ltd.’s Board of Directors on 1 September 2020, and Nikon X-Tek Systems
Ltd.’s Board of Directors on 28 August 2020.

Participating with the Fair Labor Association (FLA), Quality Certification Alliance (QCA) and
Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC)
In November 2012, the Fair Labor Association (FLA) recognized SanMar for its dedication to the Fair Labor and
Responsible Sourcing Principles when it accredited our compliance program.
Among our many obligations as an accredited participating Company, we have demonstrated our commitment to:
Upholding the FLA's code of conduct and established systems to identify and remedy ethical violations
Working with the FLA to develop and improve social compliance systems that flag issues and lead to
sustainable solutions when workers are at risk.
Monitoring our supply chain partners to ensure they meet strict labor standards.
For a complete list of the fair labor and responsible sourcing principles that guide our sourcing activities and the
FLA's Workplace Code of Conduct, please visit the FLA website at www.fairlabor.org.
In January 2014 the Quality Certification Alliance (QCA) recognized SanMar as an accredited company. A leading
promotional products industry organization. the QCA verifies company practices to consistently provide quality,
compliant and socially responsible promotional products into the marketplace. For more information about the
QCA, please visit www.qcalliance.org.
In April 2017 SanMar joined the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC), a group of nearly 200 global brands,
retailers, manufacturers, government, non-profit environmental organizations and academic institutions committed
to improving supply chain sustainability in the apparel, footwear and textile industries. As part of its SAC
membership, SanMar will use the group’s sustainability measurement tool, the Higg Index, to drive environmental
and social responsibility throughout its supply chain. Learn more at http://apparelcoalition.org/.

Supply Chain Disclosure
SanMar is committed to conducting business in a socially responsible manner. This includes acknowledging our
responsibility to ensure that slavery and trafficking do not occur in our supply chain. We seek to comply with all
applicable national laws where we do business and to respect international principles aimed at preventing and
eradicating trafficking and slavery, as described in the 2000 United Nations ""Palermo Protocol"" and the 1926
Slavery Convention.
The 2010 California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (the Act), which became effective January 1, 2012,
requires that companies disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our supply chain. Our
Global Operating Principles – a set of principles based on the International Labor Organization's standards
addresses forced labor, child labor, harassment or abuse, discrimination, wages, freedom of association, and more
to protect against the risks associated with the trafficking and slavery of workers.

Monitoring Our Facilities
Third-party verification of our Global Operating Principles is rigorous and strengthened by the FLA's independent
and random factory monitoring. As an FLA accredited participating company, our suppliers are required to submit
to independent monitoring by the FLA. Factories that are selected for monitoring are chosen at random by the FLA

without any prior knowledge to either the factory or to SanMar. We believe this creates a high level of
accountability and transparency at the factories which manufacture our products.
In addition to the FLA's monitoring activities, both our Compliance Team and independent third-party auditors
perform periodic announced and unannounced compliance audits at the facilities of each supplier involved in the
production of our proprietary products. If remediation is required, our Compliance Team works closely with the
supplier and the facility to ensure that timely corrective actions are taken, including appropriate monitoring and
verification.
We are proud of our affiliation with the FLA and continue to evaluate and develop improved and comprehensive
human rights policies, supplier monitoring and training programs, worker hotline channels, and other best practices
aimed at ensuring full compliance throughout the supply chain of our private label products.

MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT 2018
Save the Childen Interatnional Modern Slavery Annual Statement
2018
Save the Children is the world’s leading independent organisation for children. This year marks Save the
Children’s 100 year anniversary. Since its inception, Save the Children has worked to ensure all children
survive, have access to a quality basic education, and are protected from all forms of violence.
Save the Children has worked in a number of ways to address issues of child exploitation in the various
places we have worked, helping to drive change in communities, and seeking to prevent modern slavery
and human trafficking. Save the Children welcomed the introduction of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015
and the milestone it represented in ensuring that organisations take steps to act against this grave
violation of human rights, which often preys on children. Between 2016 and 2018, Save the Children
International (SCI) has worked in diverse ways and across a range of industries in order to address the
involvement of children with harmful work.
SCI has implemented measures to combat child protection violations associated with cocoa, tea and
vanilla value chains in Cote d’Ivoire, Sri Lanka and Madagascar, respectively. Examples of such
measures include: removing children from exploitative working conditions in cotton farming and brick
kilns in India; addressing child protection issues in the cocoa industry in the Dominican Republic;
supporting companies and governments to adopt child protection policies and monitoring systems which
enable children to attend or return to school, such as in Cote d’Ivoire. Save the Children also recently
contributed to the Modern Slavery Act Review, making a joint submission with other campaigners in this
area.

Focusing on practical measures to prevent and detect modern slavery, and ensuring that those it works
with do the same, is consistent with Save the Children’s vision, mission and values. Measures to
counter modern slavery and human trafficking are embedded into the work we do around the world,

Modern Slavery Statement 2018 | Save the Children International

As a global movement Save the Children is made up of 28 independent national organisations, each of
which is a member of the movement’s central body, the Save the Children Association (SCA). Members
lead on activities within their home territory and work with donors to develop programmes abroad, which
are delivered by the movement’s implementing body - Save the Children International (SCI) - via teams
on the ground in each country. SCI is a UK charity and company limited by guarantee headquartered in
London, functioning through SCI’s network of 5 regional offices and 55 country offices operating
programmes in 61 countries. SCI provides development and humanitarian programming and campaign,
policy and advocacy work to drive change for children, including those living in some of the most difficult
and dangerous places in the world.

Follow us on Twitter

Share it

Together with the 28 national members, SCI works in over 120 countries worldwide to inspire
breakthroughs in the way the world treats children and to achieve immediate and lasting change in their
lives. All the members of Save the Children, with combined revenues of over $2 billion, are working to
deliver a shared strategy – Ambition for Children 2030.

This statement is SCI’s Modern Slavery Statement. It builds on SCI’s previous Modern Slavery
Statements, available on our website here, detailing the steps we have taken to help prevent and
eliminate risks of modern slavery in our business and supply chains.

(i)

SCI’s business

SCI employs approximately 16,500 people across its offices globally, in addition to volunteers and
contractors. We have human resources functions in the country and regional offices where we work, and
primarily hire our workforce directly and locally, through the relevant local HR functions, although in
some instances we use agencies to assist with our recruitment. Further information about how our
recruitment procedures help prevent risks of modern slavery are detailed below.

Modern Slavery Statement 2018 | Save the Children International

SCI has a very complex, dispersed, supply chain. SCI is not involved in manufacturing, agriculture or
retail industries, which are typically high risk activities for modern slavery. However, at least 80% of
SCI’s procurement is sourced in country by SCI’s 56 country offices. These are located in some of the
most challenging conditions in the world, and SCI recognises the risk of modern slavery in that context
and takes it very seriously. SCI is currently developing an online procurement platform, to automate
many source to pay procedures, and its procurement systems across the organisation will gradually be
transitioned onto this system. The platform aims to simplify procurement procedures enabling greater
visibility over SCI’s supply chain and enabling increased compliance.

Modern Slavery Statement 2018 | Save the Children International

SCI delivers approximately 15% of its portfolio through partners. These are often organisations based in
the countries in which SCI operates and delivers its programming. SCI has a Head of Partnerships at
SCI’s headquarters in London, and regional and country office partnership focal points across our
movement. We continue to work with partners to ensure that modern slavery is not present in their
operations and programming.

B: Our values and policies

(i)

Mandatory staff policies

As detailed in SCI’s previous modern slavery statements, our Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking
policy sets out SCI’s zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and its commitment to ensuring that
modern slavery is not taking place in its business and supply chains. This approach is supported
through a framework focusing on awareness, prevention, reporting and responding.

In addition to our Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy, SCI has a number of policies in place
which are mandatory for staff to sign, and which help us to combat modern slavery, including our Code
of Conduct, Child Safeguarding Policy, Fraud, Bribery and Corruption Policy and Anti-Harassment and
Bullying Policy.

SCI’s Recruitment Policy and Procedure, Reward Policies and Relocation Policies embed the principles
through which SCI recruits and helps ensure that modern slavery is not present within SCI’s own
business.

(ii)

Supply Chain and Partners

During 2018, SCI rolled out its Procurement Policy, which is essential to the operation of country and
regional offices, and the accompanying Procurement Manual; these documents assist local teams to
ensure that they are following agreed processes, and are aware of the policies and procedures which
we expect them and our suppliers to comply with, including our Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking
https://www.savethechildren.net/modern-slavery-statement-2018

4/14

6/14/2019

Modern Slavery Statement 2018 | Save the Children International

Policy. The essential standard detailed in the Procurement Policy sets out SCI’s ambition to meet the
highest ethical and professional standards in its interactions with suppliers and in compliance with all
legal and ethical requirements, and to ensure suppliers adopt similar codes of conduct in their business
dealings. In 2018, a significant amount of training was delivered to Procurement teams globally which
reiterated compliance with policies. Following the training, staff have to complete a test to confirm their
competence and understanding.

Our Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy has been embedded as a mandatory policy in our
revised template partner agreements (rolled out in 2018) and our spectrum of global template supplier
contracts and tender invitations. Strict provisions have also been embedded in, and are fundamental to,
our construction contract template, as we recognise the higher risk of modern slavery in this industry.
Other policies to which our Suppliers are subject, such as our Child Safeguarding Policy, our Fraud
Bribery and Corruption Policy, and the Inter-Agency Procurement Group Agencies and Suppliers Code
of Conduct, set out SCI’s expectations of suppliers and help prevent instances of modern slavery. SCI
also has comprehensive resources aimed at ensuring compliance with US Government and USAID AntiHuman Trafficking Provisions.

C. Our actions

We have been taking the following steps to help improve our existing structures and systems and raise
awareness, prevent, detect and respond to risks of modern slavery:

(i)

Due diligence processes

SCI’s business
Staff awareness: Staff awareness about modern slavery is key to ensuring that suspicious behaviours
and indicators of modern slavery are flagged early on, and appropriately managed. Details of training
currently available to staff are set out below in ‘Awareness and Training’.
Recruitment practices: Our recruitment practices help prevent the risk of modern slavery within our
business. Our recruitment agreements and policies are managed locally, based on global templates and
principles but adapted for the relevant local context and applicable law. Some of the measures which
SCI has in place include:
https://www.savethechildren.net/modern-slavery-statement-2018

5/14

6/14/2019

Modern Slavery Statement 2018 | Save the Children International

Conducting regular salary reviews to ensure that staff get paid a living wage in the countries it
operates in, and benchmarking salaries to ensure that they remain competitive in the sector;
Conducting background checks as part of the recruitment process;
Checking, but not withholding, identity documents and rights to work documentation;
Providing information on workers’ rights in a language they can understand;
Not allowing for fines or for workers to be charged finders’ fees within its contracts, and not
deducting accommodation or transport costs from staff salaries.

SCI’s Supply Chain
Our existing processes require that all potential new suppliers be vetted locally and globally and that
local teams, who understand the local context, consider risks associated with a potential supplier and
make risk based decisions for each sourcing activity.
Following its development and early rollout in 2017, in 2018 we continued to roll out our Procurement
Manual (which includes information about our Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy) to cover
the vast majority of country offices. In 2019, we are updating the manual, integrating further practical
steps on conducting diligence on potential suppliers and identifying risks of modern slavery within their
businesses.

SCI’s Partners
We ensure partner due diligence through conducting both mandatory partner vetting, and embedding
questions concerning modern slavery and human trafficking in our mandatory Partnership Assessment
Tool, to assess qualification of partners to deliver programmes together with us. This assists in
considering and highlighting potential issues around modern slavery in partners we are considering
working with.

(ii)

Identifying, assessing and managing risks of modern slavery

Risk assessments: Keeping the children and people we work with safe is one of Save the Children’s top
priorities. SCI has various risk assessment tools, which assist our staff to identify risks and effective

https://www.savethechildren.net/modern-slavery-statement-2018

6/14

6/14/2019

Modern Slavery Statement 2018 | Save the Children International

mitigations, including tackling the risk of modern slavery amongst potential suppliers and partners, and
in humanitarian responses. We are committed to strengthening these tools.

Humanitarian Response Risk Assessments: There can be a higher risk of modern slavery and trafficking
in the context of humanitarian crises. New risk assessment templates, which SCI started using in 2018
together with risk guidance documents, are now completed at the start of any major humanitarian
response, and reviews of its controls are also conducted afterwards. The risk assessment includes
specific questions around modern slavery and human trafficking (particularly in the context of supply
chain), and broader questions around operational risk also enable modern slavery risks to be identified.

Child Safeguarding Tools: Our child safeguarding tools, which include risk assessments, training, and
dedicated Child Safeguarding focal points in each SCI location, are also supportive of an approach to
identifying, preventing, reporting and following up with risks and incidents of modern slavery and human
trafficking. In 2018, we completed new comprehensive risk guidance and a new risk tool which further
improves our prevention work around exploitation and abuse, which is being rolled out in 2019.

New Partnership Assessment Tool: During 2018, we rolled out a new mandatory Partnership
Assessment Tool, which incorporates questions on modern slavery and human trafficking to help us
identify risks associated with prospective partners with whom we plan to deliver our programmes.

Supplier visits: Our local teams determine whether to conduct inspections of suppliers, and tend to focus
on programmes such as nutrition and pharma where product quality is critical. We have reporting
mechanisms in place for reporting modern slavery concerns, detailed within our Modern Slavery and
Human Trafficking Policy. Where an issue is reported in relation to a supplier and an investigation is
commenced, the investigation team determines whether a visit to the supplier’s premises is necessary.

Supplier warnings: In our supply chain, our locally managed databases record the vetting status of
suppliers and whether that status has been affected by, for example, violations of our ethical standards
(including where they have been involved in perpetrating modern slavery) and to ensure that they are
not used by our organisation. Our global procurement system, which is currently being developed, will
enable this information to be visible at a global level, to enable enhanced compliance across the
contexts in which we work.

Modern Slavery Statement 2018 | Save the Children International

Procurement manual updates: Updates to our procurement manual in 2019 will include more detailed
information about how to investigate, and act on reports of modern slavery within SCI’s supply chain.
This is in addition to existing internal reporting mechanisms we have in place to escalate issues which
have been identified.

Reporting: SCI’s Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy encourages suspicions and concerns to
be reported through its procedures. Concerns involving children may also be reported through our child
safeguarding reporting mechanism. Reports are monitored by our dedicated Child Safeguarding team
and appropriate action is taken against perpetrators. The corrective action will be determined according
to the details of the case, and may include suspension or termination of our arrangement with a
partner/supplier, referrals to police, working with the local community, and disciplinary action taken
against involvement of any SCI staff member. SCI has recently introduced new software to make
reporting more accessible to staff and improve monitoring of cases from start to finish. This software
currently enables modern slavery concerns to be reported through limited categories of child
safeguarding or fraud. We are currently exploring how to integrate modern slavery/human trafficking into
the reporting mechanism through the software, alongside other changes being made to the system to
improve the breadth of what the reporting software captures. We are also considering ways of using the
data outcomes from the software to more robustly conduct trend analyses and future incident
prevention. In 2018, our global Whistleblowing policy and procedure was revised, with the rollout
scheduled to take place this year. Whilst we currently have local whistleblowing hotlines in some high
risk areas, SCI is now introducing a global whistleblowing hotline. These measures should facilitate
increased reporting across the organisation.

(iii)

Awareness and training

Staff: Modern slavery training is integrated into two of our mandatory new starter training courses:

(a) Mandatory global online human resources induction for new starters. This is accessible by our staff
across the world and explains what modern slavery is, how staff might spot it, SCI’s policy and how to
report any suspected incidents. SCI started to roll out ‘in person’ human resources inductions across the
organisation in 2018, which clarify and reinforce that both completion of the global induction and
adherence to the Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy are mandatory. It is hoped that these
completion figures will rise as a result.

8/14

6/14/2019

Modern Slavery Statement 2018 | Save the Children International

(b) Mandatory Child Safeguarding Training. Preventing the exploitation and abuse of children is central
to our organisation’s aims and our mandatory ‘in person’ Child Safeguarding training previously
indirectly addressed the issue of modern slavery and trafficking of children. In 2018, we refreshed our
inperson interactive training, which now includes enhanced information about modern slavery, including
its prevalence, how it may be detected and reported. This revised training is delivered at our
headquarters. This has also been shared globally with our child-safeguarding leads across the
organisation, who adapt the training according to the specific requirements and needs in the regions and
countries they oversee. Modern slavery information is also being incorporated into other safeguarding
trainings for teams across the organisation (such as our supply chain, safety and security specialist and
humanitarian teams), and in additional humanitarian training.

In addition, Safeguarding training, which is being rolled out to our procurement teams globally in 2019
and includes information on modern slavery, encourages our country and regional offices to consider
safeguarding risks in their own contexts and how these should be addressed.

Suppliers: With over 100,000 suppliers globally, it is not feasible to have a centralised training
programme for all our suppliers across our supply chain. Our country and regional offices identify risks
arising through their supplier due diligence work that they engage in, and provide support and
clarification where needed on modern slavery to suppliers. We also engage with suppliers on a case-bycase basis to address queries regarding our contractual requirements (including with regard to our
mandatory Modern Slavery policy). SCI provides training to suppliers in some contexts, and this is
determined at the local level. SCI recently delivered training to suppliers in Bangladesh (where over 400
people were present) and Nepal, for example.

Partners: Our International Safeguarding team is incorporating information on modern slavery into our
partner safeguarding training.

D: Measuring our effectiveness
In last year’s statement, information on measuring SCI’s effectiveness in ensuring that modern slavery
and human trafficking is not taking place in its supply chains was integrated throughout the statement.
For clarity, we have set this out separately in this years’ statement.

As mentioned above, with over 100,000 suppliers globally, it is not
feasible for SCI to visit all of its supply chain. Moreover, SCI is
reconsidering this performance indicator and whether it serves as a
useful measure of success in combatting modern slavery currently.

Monitor any reports and
accounts of modern slavery
in SCI’s supply and
corrective action taken

SCI did not receive any reports of modern slavery through its global
whistleblowing channel in 2018. SCI received some reports of child
labour in its local in-country supply chains through its child safeguarding
reporting channel in 2018. These were dealt with appropriately at the
local level, and reported to SCI’s trustees and the Charity Commission as
appropriate. SCI anticipates that through the efforts being made to
increase awareness of this issue amongst its staff, partners and
suppliers, and through the improvements being made to its reporting
mechanisms, modern slavery can be exposed and rooted out where it
exists.

E. Our commitments

SCI is committed to the continuing evaluation of our systems and processes to ensure that we can
better raise awareness of, prevent, report and respond to issues of modern slavery across the
organisation.

Some of the actions which SCI will be taking in 2019 include:

Strengthening existing processes and tools to ensure that modern slavery aspects are addressed
more robustly, including:
A further review of modern slavery risks within our business to assess where our current
approach can be strengthened;
Enhancing our existing local and global whistleblowing mechanisms, including the roll out
of an updated whistleblowing policy and procedure;
Enhancing SCI’s procurement manual to provide more information to our local teams
about modern slavery, including how to identify, report and ultimately prevent such risks
within the supply chain;
Strengthening aspects of the new risk assessment template for humanitarian emergencies
to incorporate modern slavery elements.
Developing the post-humanitarian crisis control review to incorporate modern slavery and
human trafficking considerations more robustly.
The development of a global on-boarding process for SCI’s contractors and volunteers, which
ensures that such workers sign off on SCI’s mandatory policies (including the Modern Slavery
and Human Trafficking policy) and complete SCI’s mandatory training.
An increased focus on safeguarding generally, including staff training and expanded policies.
The development of a framework agreement to be used for recruitment agencies in the UK (with
a view to global use in the future), in which SCI’s Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy is
embedded as a mandatory policy.
Continuing to roll out SCI’s Procurement Policy and accompanying procurement manual globally.
The staged introduction of a global platform to manage supply contracts, which should enable
SCI to ensure that its contracts with organisations comply with its mandatory policies (including
Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking).
Considering more effective performance indicators to measure effectiveness of measures to
mitigate the risk of modern slavery in our supply chain.
Continued delivery of child safeguarding training and guidelines to SCI’s supply chain staff
globally, which incorporates information on modern slavery, helping local teams to identify and
address risk areas in their contexts and providing awareness of existing tools and how to use
them. Going forward, introducing country-specific requirements regarding training suppliers.

HOME

Save the Children welcomed the introduction of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 as it is consistent
with SCI’s own values and missions in the work that it does. Since the introduction of the Act in
2015, SCI has undertaken a number of initiatives internally to implement this prevention work
across in our supply chain, partners and across our business and has also worked with
communities to drive change.
Examples of our work with communities include a number of Save the Children projects aimed at
preventing and responding to child trafficking across the globe, with notable examples in Italy, Sri
Lanka, Mozambique, Central America and West Africa. These programmes typically include the
following core components:
Training of law enforcement officers and social welfare workers to identify, interview and
provide appropriate care to child victims of trafficking;
Supporting the recovery and rehabilitation of child victims through information, mental health
and psychosocial support and counselling, and reintegration into education, training and
employment opportunities; undertaking family tracing and reunification;
Providing support to families to prevent (re) trafficking, through economic strengthening and
raising awareness; and
Working with governments to strengthen their systems, legal frameworks and policies to
prevent and respond to trafficking, including advocacy to ensure appropriate care and
deinstitutionalization of child victims.
Save the Children also works on child protection issues within supply chains, including child labour.
In 2019 programming in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Madagascar, Sri Lanka and Vietnam included
this work. An example from Sri Lanka is Save the Children’s work with tea plantation companies to
encourage the voluntarily adoption of a child protection policy. Five companies have voluntarily
adopted a policy of 10 standards, one of which is that “no child below that age of 16 engages in
paid or unpaid labour, and no child between ages 16 and 18 years engages in hazardous
occupations, in accordance with Sri Lankan laws and regulations”.

A: OUR STRUCTURE AND SUPPLY CHAIN
As a global movement Save the Children is made up of 27 Members (national organisations) and 3
Associate Members, each of which is a member of the movement’s central body, Save the Children
Association (SCA). Members lead on activities within their home territory and work with donors to
develop programmes abroad, which are delivered by the movement’s implementing body, Save the
Children International (SCI), via in-country teams working on the ground. SCI is a UK charity and
company limited by guarantee, headquartered in London and functioning through SCI’s network of
5 regional offices and 56 country offices operating in 75 geographical territories. SCI provides
development and humanitarian programming and campaign, policy and advocacy work to drive
change for children, including those living in some of the most difficult and dangerous places in the
world.
Together with the 27 National Members and 3 Associate Members, SCI worked in 117 countries in
2019 to inspire breakthroughs in the way the world treats children and to achieve immediate and
lasting change in their lives. All the members of Save the Children, with combined revenues of over
$2 billion, are working to deliver a shared strategy – Ambition for Children 2030.
This statement is SCI’s Modern Slavery Statement. It builds on SCI’s previous Modern Slavery
Statements, available on our website here, detailing the steps we have taken to help prevent and
eliminate risks of modern slavery in our business and supply chains.

(I) SCI’S BUSINESS
SCI employs approximately 15,500 people across its offices globally, in addition to volunteers and
contractors. We have human resources functions in the country and regional offices where we
work, and primarily hire our workforce directly and locally, through the relevant local HR
functions, although in some instances we use agencies to assist with our recruitment. Further
information about how our recruitment procedures help prevent risks of modern slavery are
detailed below.

(II) SCI'S SUPPLY CHAIN
SCI has a very complex, dispersed, supply chain. SCI is not involved in manufacturing, agriculture
or retail industries, which are typically high risk activities for modern slavery.
The scale of SCI’s supply chain operations is underlined by our Supply Chain Key Statistics:
$392m - third party supplier spend
2,500 - supply chain headcount
363 warehouses
3,703 vehicles in SCI’s fleet
At least 80% of SCI’s procurement is sourced in-country by SCI’s 56 country offices. SCI recognises

the risk of modern slavery in these countries and takes this very seriously. SCI is currently
developing an online global procurement platform, to automate many source-to-pay procedures,
and its local, in country, procurement systems across the organisation will gradually be
transitioned onto this global IT system. The prospective platform aims to simplify procurement
procedures enabling greater visibility over SCI’s supply chain and enabling increased compliance.

(III) SCI’S PARTNERSHIPS
SCI delivers approximately 18-19 % of its portfolio through partners. These are often local not-forprofit organisations based in the countries in which SCI operates and delivers its programming. SCI
has a Head of Partnerships at SCI’s headquarters in London, and regional and country office
partnership focal points across our movement. We continue to work with partners to ensure that
modern slavery is not present in their operations and programming.

B: OUR VALUES AND POLICIES
(I) MANDATORY STAFF POLICIES
As detailed in SCI’s previous modern slavery statements, our Modern Slavery and Human
Trafficking policy sets out SCI’s zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and its commitment to
ensuring that modern slavery is not taking place in its operations and supply chains. This approach
is supported through a framework focusing on awareness, prevention, reporting and responding.
In addition to our Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy, SCI has a number of policies in
place which are mandatory for staff to sign, and which help us to combat modern slavery, including
our Code of Conduct, Child Safeguarding Policy, Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse
Policy and Anti-Harassment and Bullying Policy. In 2019 SCI started the development of an elearning module on Modern Slavery Awareness. The rollout for this module had planned to be the
latter half of 2020, but the timing of its rollout is now dependent on the status of the progress of
the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on SCI’s operations in countries around the world.
SCI’s Recruitment Policy and Procedure, Reward Policies and Relocation Policies embed the
principles through which SCI recruits and helps ensure that modern slavery is not present within
SCI’s own business.
In 2019 SCI developed a global on-boarding process for SCI’s contractors which ensures that such
workers sign SCI’s mandatory policies (including the Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking
policy) and complete SCI’s mandatory training prior to starting work with SCI.
We have also enhanced our existing local and global whistleblowing mechanisms, including the roll
out of an updated whistleblowing policy and procedure. We now have a Global Whistleblowing
Officer in place, who oversees the whistleblowing process, and have appointed staff members
within our country offices to manage whistleblowing complaints at country office level. We have
several channels available for staff members who wish to make a whistleblowing complaint,

including an internal incident reporting system and an external hotline, for those staff members
who do not feel comfortable using our internal reporting channels.

(II) SUPPLY CHAIN AND PARTNERS
Our Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy has been embedded as a mandatory policy in
our revised template partner agreements (rolled out in 2018) and our spectrum of key global
template supplier contracts and tender invitations. Strict provisions have also been embedded in,
and are fundamental to, our construction contract template, as we recognise the higher risk of
modern slavery in this industry. Other policies to which our Suppliers are subject, such as our Child
Safeguarding Policy, our Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse Policy, our AntiHarassment, Intimidation and Bullying Policy and the Inter-Agency Procurement Group Agencies
and Suppliers Code of Conduct set out SCI’s expectations of suppliers and help prevent instances of
modern slavery. SCI also has comprehensive resources aimed at ensuring compliance with US
Government and USAID Anti-Human Trafficking Provisions.
In 2019, SCI has also enhanced its procurement manual, originally launched in 2018, to provide
more information to our local teams about modern slavery, including how to identify, report and
ultimately prevent such risks within the supply chain. We have also continued to roll out SCI’s
Procurement Policy alongside the enhanced manual. In January 2020, SCI deployed an updated
version of Procurement Essentials, a functional training course, which includes enhanced sections
on all SCI’s compliance standards, including Modern Slavery. This is a mandatory training course
for all procurement staff, equipping staff with a compliance checklist to use when assessing
suppliers, linking to SCI’s overall policy on Modern Slavery.

C: OUR ACTIONS
(I) DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES
SCI’S BUSINESS
Staff awareness: Staff awareness about modern slavery is key to ensuring that suspicious
behaviours and indicators of modern slavery are flagged early on, and appropriately managed.
Details of training currently available to staff are set out below in ‘Awareness and Training’.
Recruitment practices: Our recruitment practices help prevent the risk of modern slavery within
our business. Our recruitment agreements and policies are managed locally, based on global
templates and principles but adapted for the relevant local context and applicable law.
In 2019 we developed a framework agreement to be used for recruitment agencies in the UK (with
a view to global use in the future), in which SCI’s Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy is
embedded as a mandatory policy.
Some of the other measures which SCI has in place include:

Conducting vetting checks of prospective recruit before offer of employment given and a
police and reference check prior to start date (double-stage process);
Conducting regular salary reviews to ensure that staff get paid a living wage in the countries
it operates in, and benchmarking salaries to ensure that they remain competitive in the sector;
Checking, but not withholding, identity documents and rights to work documentation;
Providing information on workers’ rights in a language they can understand;
Not allowing: fines levied to be passed onto employees, for workers to be charged finders’
fees, and not deducting accommodation or transport costs from staff salaries.

SCI’S SUPPLY CHAIN
In 2019, SCI began the staged introduction of a global IT platform to manage supply contracts,
which should help SCI to ensure, globally, that its contracts with suppliers comply with its
mandatory policies (including our policy on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking).

SCI’S PARTNERS
We ensure partner due diligence through conducting both mandatory partner vetting, and
embedding questions concerning modern slavery and human trafficking in our mandatory
Partnership Assessment Tool, to assess qualification of partners to deliver programmes together
with us. This assists in considering and highlighting potential issues around modern slavery in
partners we are considering working with.

(II) IDENTIFYING, ASSESSING AND MANAGING RISKS IN MODERN SLAVERY
Risk assessments: In 2019 SCI rolled out comprehensive risk guidance and a new humanitarian
safeguarding risk tool which further improves our prevention work around exploitation and abuse.
Our new risk assessment template for humanitarian responses was strengthened with modern
slavery elements.
Child Safeguarding Tools: Our child safeguarding tools, which include risk assessments, training,
and dedicated Child Safeguarding focal points in each SCI country office, are also supportive of an
approach to identifying, preventing, reporting and following up with risks and incidents of modern
slavery and human trafficking.
Supplier visits: Our local teams determine whether to conduct inspections of suppliers, and tend to
focus on programmes such as nutrition and pharma where product quality is critical. In our
procedures, we apply a risk-based approach (with focus on modern slavery and human trafficking)
to determine whether a visit is necessary. We have reporting mechanisms in place for reporting
modern slavery concerns, detailed within our Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy.
Where an issue is reported in relation to a supplier and an investigation is commenced, the
investigation team determines whether a visit to the supplier’s premises is necessary.
Supplier warnings: In our supply chain, our databases record the vetting status of suppliers. Our
vetting systems draw from a broad range of criminal records that are public as well as adverse
media reports, which if public, would identify perpetrators. If the supplier does not pass our vetting

process we will not work with the supplier.
Procurement manual updates: Updates to our procurement manual in 2019 included more detailed
information about how to increase awareness, assess risk and report of modern slavery within
SCI’s supply chain. This is in addition to existing internal reporting mechanisms we have in place to
escalate issues that have been identified.
Reporting: SCI’s Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy encourages suspicions and concerns
to be reported through its procedures. Concerns involving children may also be reported through
our child safeguarding reporting mechanism and any concerns relating to sexual exploitation as
defined in Anti-Harassment, Intimidation and Bullying Policy. Reports are monitored by the
relevant teams and appropriate action is taken against perpetrators. The corrective action will be
determined according to the details of the case, and may include suspension or termination of our
arrangement with a partner/supplier, referrals to police, working with the local community, and
disciplinary action taken against any SCI staff member involved.

(III) AWARENESS AND TRAINING
In addition to our Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy, SCI has a number of policies in
place which are mandatory for staff to sign, and which help us to combat modern slavery, including
our Code of Conduct, Child Safeguarding Policy, Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse
Policy and Anti-Harassment and Bullying Policy. In 2019 SCI started the development of an elearning module on Modern Slavery Awareness. The rollout for this module had planned to be the
latter half of 2020, but the timing of its rollout is now dependent on the status of the progress of
the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on SCI’s operations in countries around the world.
Details of training available to staff is set out throughout this statement and there is training still in
development. The below figures provide information in relation to training conducted in 2019:
Mandatory child safeguarding training (incorporating modern slavery training). Preventing the
exploitation and abuse of children is central to our organisation’s aims and our mandatory ‘in
person’ Child Safeguarding training previously indirectly addressed the issues of modern slavery
and human trafficking in children. During 2019, 89% of SCI staff attended the mandatory child
safeguarding training.
Mandatory global human resources online induction for new starters (incorporating elements of
modern slavery) accessible by our staff across the world and explains what modern slavery is, how
staff might spot it, SCI’s policy and how to report any suspected incidents. During 2019, 67% of
new starters completed the mandatory online induction.
If SCI receives any reports of child labour and modern slavery they are reported via SCI’s
whistleblowing or safeguarding channels and dealt with appropriately at the local level. The SCI’s
trustees and the Charity Commission are notified of any reports as appropriate. SCI anticipates
that through the efforts being made to increase awareness of this issue amongst its staff, partners

and suppliers, and the access to reporting mechanisms, modern slavery can be exposed and rooted
out where it exists.
2019 was a year in which SCI committed to an increased focus on safeguarding generally, including
staff training and expanded policies. Modern slavery information is incorporated into safeguarding
trainings for teams across the organisation (such as our general induction training, supply chain,
safety and security specialist and humanitarian teams) and in additional humanitarian training, for
example our supply chain delivered child safeguarding training and guidelines to 170 supply chain
staff across the globe. Going forward, we will be introducing country-specific requirements
regarding training suppliers.
Suppliers: With over 100,000 suppliers globally, it is not feasible to have a centralised training
programme for all our suppliers across our supply chain. Our country and regional offices identify
risks arising through their supplier due diligence work that they engage in, and provide support and
clarification where needed on modern slavery to suppliers. We also engage with suppliers on a
case-by-case basis to address queries regarding our contractual requirements (including with
regard to our mandatory Modern Slavery policy). SCI provides training to suppliers in some
contexts, and this is determined at the local level.
Partners: Our International Safeguarding team incorporate information on modern slavery into
our partner safeguarding training.

D: OUR COMMITMENTS
SCI is committed to the continuing evaluation of our systems and processes to ensure that we can
better raise awareness of, prevent, report and respond to issues of modern slavery across the
organisation.
Some of the actions which SCI will be taking in 2020 include:
Strengthening existing processes and tools to ensure that modern slavery aspects are
addressed more robustly.
A sustained focus on safeguarding generally, including staff training and expanded policies.
Continuing to roll out SCI’s Procurement Policy and accompanying procurement manual
globally.
The continued preparation for the roll-out of a global platform to manage supply contracts,
which should enable SCI to ensure that its contracts with organisations comply with its
mandatory policies (including Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking).
Continued delivery of child safeguarding training and guidelines to SCI’s supply chain staff
globally, which incorporates information on modern slavery, helping local teams to identify
and address risk areas in their contexts and providing awareness of existing tools and how to
use them.
Considering country-specific requirements regarding training suppliers.

Embedding the use of comprehensive risk guidance and a new safeguarding risk tool that
further improves our prevention work around exploitation and abuse.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and
constitutes SCI’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31
December 2019. It was approved by the Board of Save the Children International on 26 May
2020, and published on SCI’s website on 26 June.

Modern Slavery and Human Traﬃcking Statement

Modern Slavery and Human Traﬃcking
Statement
This statement is made pursuant to Section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and Part 2 of the Australian Modern
Slavery Act 2018 and highlights the programs and initiatives American Airlines, Inc. has undertaken to combat modern
slavery and human trafficking during the financial year ending 2019.

Our commitment
American is committed to respecting human rights, including combating illegal human trafficking and child exploitation.
As a prominent part of the worldwide travel industry, we conduct our business in a manner that protects human rights
and the rights of children within our sphere of influence. We have adopted responsible workplace practices and
endeavour to conduct our business operations free from complicity in human rights abuses.

Our structure and operations
American is one of the largest airlines in the world, providing scheduled air transportation for both passengers and
cargo throughout the United States and around the world. Together with regional carriers flying as American Eagle, we
operate an average of 6,800 flights per day to 365 destinations in more than 60 countries. Each year, American’s
130,000 global team members serve more than 200 million customers with a unified purpose: to care for people on life’s
journey.1
1Financial year 2019 estimation

Assessment of our modern slavery risk
Each day more than half a million people trust American to safely transport them to the moments that matter most. We
fly over borders, walls, and stereotypes to connect people from different races, religions, nationalities, economic
backgrounds, and sexual orientations. Unfortunately, making the world a smaller place can come with the risk of
exploitation by human traffickers. The breadth of products and services American procures across its global supply
chain also may expose the company to modern slavery risk.
American’s assessment of its operational and supply chain risk falls within a broader enterprise-wide risk management
framework. Modern slavery risk is first assessed without consideration given to the mitigation controls American has in
place, producing an inherent risk level. In determining this inherent risk level, the company evaluates both internal and
external stakeholder data and source material.
The inherent risk is then considered in conjunction with American’s existing controls to produce an assessment of the
current, or net, level of risk. The goal of this process is to allow senior management to understand if, applying a
reasonableness test, a risk is being appropriately controlled, and if not, what additional measures should be taken.

In 2018 American also undertook a materiality analysis of environmental, social, and governance issues, which included
illegal trafficking, to identify the most critical risk areas for the company. We considered the concerns and expectations
of stakeholders to identify areas of risk as well as opportunity. To gain maximum insights, we also evaluated where the
key impacts of material issues occur across our value chain, which has allowed us to more precisely define our scope
of reporting while prioritizing strategic actions for each issue. This work will serve as a foundation for ongoing
stakeholder engagement and the development of more targeted initiatives and messaging related to our corporate
responsibility strategy.

Our program
As a global airline, we recognise our unique role and responsibility to combat human trafficking and modern slavery. We
embrace this responsibility by maintaining a human trafficking prevention program befitting our stature. American’s
program is comprised of four essential elements: (1) policies addressing human trafficking; (2) training to identify and
report suspected human trafficking; (3) internal accountability; and (4) external engagement and collaboration.

Policies
Our commitment to human rights is outlined in our Standards of Business Conduct, which require American’s team
members to uphold the human rights of all persons, including permanent and temporary team members both
domestically and internationally. We do not knowingly conduct business with any individual or company that participates
in the exploitation of children (including child labour), physical punishment, forced labour, or human trafficking.
Standards of Business Conduct »
As a U.S. federal government contractor, American is subject to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and
implementing Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.222-50 – Combating Trafficking in Persons – which was enacted
to combat all forms of human trafficking and forced labour. We have adopted both a Policy Prohibiting Trafficking in
Persons and a Combating Trafficking in Persons Compliance Plan that serve as guides to address and comply with
these regulatory requirements. We also flow down FAR 52.222-50 as required to our government subcontractors and
agents. Any violations of the FAR or American’s policy prohibiting trafficking in persons by team members, agents, or
subcontractors may result in the agent’s or subcontractor's removal from the contract, termination of the contract,
reduction in a team member’s benefits, or termination of employment.
American’s policies and other information on human trafficking and modern slavery, including links to educational and
training resources, are available to all team members on the company’s intranet site.

Training
American provides human trafficking awareness training to our pilots, flight attendants and airport customer service
team members. We also provide anti-trafficking training to team members with relevant purchasing responsibilities,
including those who conduct on-site visits to American’s international suppliers on how to recognise signs of human
trafficking and what action to take if they suspect human trafficking. All told, we train over 70,000 team members each
year.

Internal accountability
American encourages the reporting of any incidents of suspected human trafficking or other activity inconsistent with
our Standards of Business Conduct. American’s Business Ethics helpline, EthicsPoint, is available 24/7 to all team
members and those with whom we do business. They can call a toll-free number or use an online, secure web portal to
ask questions or report questionable conduct. The helpline is available system wide, and reporters can remain

anonymous. American’s Business Ethics & Compliance Office and Legal department also receive reports by telephone,
mail, and email. We also inform team members that they may report any activity inconsistent with U.S. government
policy or American’s policy by contacting The National Human Trafficking Hotline.
We will protect anyone suspected of being victims of or witnesses to prohibited activities. We will also cooperate fully
with any trafficking-related audits and investigations by the U.S. federal government, including providing reasonable
access to our facilities and staff.
American has a zero-tolerance policy against retaliation. Any team member who violates this policy will be subject to
appropriate discipline, including reduction in benefits or termination of employment.

External engagement and collaboration
Collaboration with government agencies, industry partners, and non-government organisations is a key facet of our
human trafficking prevention program.
In January 2018 American signed ECPAT-USA’s Tourism Child-Protection Code of Conduct. ECPAT-USA is the leading
policy organisation in the United States seeking to end the commercial, sexual exploitation of children. The Code, which
represents a joint venture between the tourism private sector and ECPAT, is a voluntary set of business principles travel
and tour companies can implement to prevent child sex tourism and trafficking of children.
We also joined Texas Businesses Against Trafficking (TBAT), a business partnership established by the Office of the
Texas Secretary of State aimed at combating human trafficking by fostering collaboration between the public and
private sectors in Texas. American was recognised for its commitment to combating human trafficking by the Texas
Secretary of State at the inaugural TBAT forum in October 2019.
Other activities in 2019 included:

■

Participating in the Working Together to End Human Trafficking Summit in Washington, D.C. on May 7, 2019.

■

Marking World Day Against Trafficking in Persons on July 30, 2019, by sharing a message with 1.6 million followers
on Twitter and publishing an American Story on the company’s Newsroom web page highlighting participation in the
Safeguarding All from Exploitation (SAFE) Action Project.

■

Sponsoring an ECPAT-USA forum on Capitol Hill for the release of the organisation’s Public Resource Guide.

■

Sponsoring a 5K run/walk at the Global Business Travel Association Convention in Chicago, which raised funds for
ECPAT-USA.

Vender management and supply chain assurance
Our commitment to running a responsible airline also extends to our supply chain. We procure high-quality, costcompetitive goods and services from more than 10,000 suppliers. The most significant elements of our supply chain
include jet fuel; aircraft and aircraft parts; inflight food and beverages; technology; and office supplies.
Key criteria for doing business with American include providing the best value in price and quality as well as having a
deep understanding of the airline industry, being financially stable, and certifying ethical business practices. These
expectations are outlined in our Standards of Business Conduct for Suppliers as well as on an accompanying Supplier
Management Portal. To ensure suppliers meet our standards, we include a risk matrix in our standard requests for
proposal, which asks about their policies and practices around labour, business ethics, the environment, health, and
safety. We monitor supplier performance against these criteria and assess potential risks, such as supply chain
disruptions.

American also encourages its suppliers to share our commitment to combat modern slavery. Through our Standards of
Business Conduct for Suppliers, we require suppliers to not use forced labour or traffic in persons. We are also adding a
provision in our supplier contract templates requiring suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations to prevent
human trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation of children, including preventing the use of American’s premises
or products for such exploitation.

Executive summary

1. Business overview

Both in the UK and abroad, modern slavery and other human rights infringements continue
to be reported in relation to business. This should act as a reminder that no company can be
satisfied that such risks do not apply to them. As a responsible business, we feel we have a
moral duty to move beyond compliance and to ensure that this issue is not a ’tick-box’ exercise.

PwC UK is a leading professional services firm, delivering assurance, consulting, deals and
tax services to clients in the public, private and not-for-profit sectors, as one of the entities
in the wider PwC Network. In the 2018 financial year we employed around 21,0005 people,
operating out of 22 offices throughout the UK while procuring services and goods that enabled
our employees to deliver our client services.

The geographic scope of this statement is PwC UK1 and relates to actions taken to address
modern slavery2 risks in our operations and supply chain during the financial year from 1st July
2017 to 30th June 2018. In reviewing these actions we’ve taken into account marketplace best
practice and stakeholder expectations.

2. Policies and
governance
2.1 Operations
We’ve had a Human Rights Policy in place, which
includes internationally recognised human rights, since 2012.
This year, to raise staff awareness around this issue, we
displayed the policy on every floor across all our offices, as
well as circulating digital communications on the topic.
Our Human Rights Policy is embedded in our culture through
our Code of Conduct (CoC), setting the tone from the top.
Each year, all employees must formally declare that they
have read and understood it.
Accountability for human rights and modern slavery relating
to our business resides with Head of Purpose, Emma Cox.
Responsibility for our policy and programme lies with the
Director of Corporate Sustainability, Bridget Jackson.
Day-to-day management, including annual review of its
relevance and effectiveness, is conducted in conjunction with
representatives, that include procurement, service owners,
and Office of General Counsel, and is led by Latifa Chomoko.

2.2 Supply chain
As a professional services firm our procurement is primarily
associated with services delivered in our offices through first
tier suppliers (such as security, maintenance, cleaning,
catering and welcome services etc.). The vast majority of our
supplier employees are on permanent or fixed term contracts.
We also buy products such as laptops, stationery and
promotional merchandise.
We recognise our responsibility to identify and address
potential or actual human rights impacts linked to the
products and services we acquire. Our approach has been to
first focus on oversight of our direct suppliers, and then to
increase visibility of the working practices in indirect
suppliers, especially those in higher risk sectors.

our Global Third Party Code of Conduct (TPCoC).
Operating in accordance with TPCoC is a fundamental
requirement for our suppliers. However, we acknowledge that
no code can address every situation that a third party may
encounter and therefore the TPCoC is not a substitute for
suppliers own accountability and responsibility to exercise
good judgment and proper business conduct.
As set out in our Human Rights Policy, where a violation
is identified we will work with all parties involved to ensure
victims have access to remedy, compensation and justice.
We’ll also investigate the root cause and take appropriate
steps with the supplier to prevent reoccurrence. Ultimately, if
we felt that our supplier’s response was unsatisfactory, we
would consider terminating the contract.

2.3 Network firms
A number of existing Global PwC policies already support
specific human rights (such as non-discrimination) across all
PwC Network member firms. Last year, we launched our
Global Human Rights Statement. This is
complementary to the UK policy, and sets out the
commitment of all PwC Network territories to uphold human
rights with our key stakeholder groups anywhere in the world.

3. Due diligence
We communicate our expectations to employees and suppliers
with regards to human rights and modern slavery, and use a
range of mechanisms to ensure that we can monitor standards in
both our operations and supply chain.

3.1 Operations
Our key asset is our people, so we have extensive processes
and programmes in place which enable us to create not only a
safe, fair and inclusive working environment, but one that is
progressive, and seeks to support wellbeing and learning.

3.2 Supply chain
Human rights is one of four priority areas in our five year
sustainable supply chain programme, shared with all key
suppliers as part of our annual feedback report. It is
embedded at each stage of our procurement cycle.
First, it forms part of our supplier evaluation during the
selection process. All new suppliers are required to sign up to
our TPCoC. Next, we’ve introduced a legally-binding clause
in our strategic supplier contracts, to ensure a proactive
approach. For instance, given that the food sector is known to
have a higher level of human rights infringements, our
catering contract has a specific requirement to manage these
risks.
We also use our annual sustainability survey to monitor the
overall performance of our key suppliers. Where responses
are deemed unsatisfactory, we suggest improvements and
offer support in implementing them.
Finally, in order to identify potential infringements amongst
employees of those companies providing us with services,
we use another biennial survey, called ‘Your Voice Matters’,
issued to all the employees of suppliers who work on our
sites. This enables them to inform PwC of any concerns,
directly, and in confidence.

We expect the same level of integrity and business conduct
from our third parties, including suppliers and their personnel,
as we do our own people. That’s why this year we launched

3

4. Risk assessment and management
We have strong risk identification and
mitigation processes in place for both
reputational and regulatory risks. Further,
our procurement risk register specifically
addresses modern slavery.
We analysed our operations and
procurement using a risk assessment
methodology based on the UN Guiding
Principles Reporting Framework. This
involved a combination of stakeholder
consultation, interviews with industry
bodies, analysis of specialist human rights
reports, desk-based supplier research and
consultation with our own internal experts.
The findings confirmed that there is a low risk
in our operations, whilst our supply chain – in
places – poses a higher risk and is an area
where we should continue to strengthen our
approach.

4.1 Procurement of services
For supplier employees working in our UK
offices the risks are relatively low, given the
national legislative context and the robust
policies and processes we have in place
throughout our business. Nevertheless, we
recognise that certain support staff – such
as cleaners and personnel working in
mailrooms – may be vulnerable groups, so
we have established procedures with our
sub-contractors to ensure that they adhere
to our required standards.
Although historically recruitment practices
were not associated with human rights risks
in the UK, poor practice has increased in
prevalence. Consequently, this year, we
performed a review to gain greater
understanding and transparency of the
recruitment process for all our office-based

support services. In the majority of cases
our suppliers are using reputable
recruitment agencies to find suitable
candidates and have appropriate policies in
place. In the limited cases where we feel
more assurance is required, we are
following up to ensure that no improper fees
are charged to prospective workers and
that no personal documents are retained by
the recruitment agencies.

4.2 Procurement of goods
The most severe risks associated with our
procurement of goods are indirect and
relate to manufacturing or sourcing of
certain raw materials. They fall into four
hotspots (information technology, food,
support staff uniforms and corporate
merchandise) totalling less than 6% of our
overall procurement this year.
Information technology
Our business relies on technology ranging
from laptops and smartphones to
equipment used in data centres. We’ve
prioritised these devices knowing there are
well-documented human rights risks
associated with these products.
Laptops issued to our staff this financial
year were manufactured in one facility in
Kunshan, China. Since China is considered
a high risk country for human rights
infringements we’re continuing to work with
our supplier to gain assurance over their
checks and practices. The supplier is a
member of the EICC, which requires their
suppliers to conform to the EICC Code of
Conduct, and suggests that they are
working to address human rights issues in
their sector.

Food
Six of our offices offer in-house catering to
our workforce. The majority of the food used
is sourced domestically. Although the UK is
considered relatively low-risk in the Global
Slavery Index, there have been a number of
cases of modern slavery in the farming
sector. This year, we plan to work with our
catering supplier to gain greater assurance
over our upstream food supply chain, looking
at recruitment practices and working
conditions.

a new uniform provider. Given that apparel is
a high risk sector for modern slavery and
labour exploitation, it featured prominently in
the selection criteria. Once a preferred
supplier was identified, we conducted human
rights due diligence until we were satisfied
that their values were aligned with our own.

Promotional merchandise
We procure promotional items which are
used at client events and for other marketing
purposes. Although not a well-known high
risk area for human rights violations, these
products carry our brand and therefore pose
a potential reputational risk. We’re working
with our supplier to increase transparency of
where these goods are made. We know that
our most popular promotional items are
manufactured in China, Germany, Italy and
the UK. In the last year, we’ve been able to
identify and secure third party ethical
assurance reports (performed within the last
three years) for the production sites of 30%
of the corporate merchandise procured in
FY18.
Currently, we are working with our supplier
to set up processes to monitor corrective
actions from third party audit reports and to
develop a rolling programme to extend
assurances over additional products. We
recognise that ethical audits of this type do
not provide absolute guarantees, but they
are currently the most effective tool available.
Uniforms
Our suppliers issue around 3,300 items of
clothing a year to our support staff. In the
last year, we put out to tender a contract for

6. Effectiveness of programmes/KPIs

Delivery of our human rights and modern slavery programme
is dependent on key personnel having a good understanding
of the issues, the legislative requirements of our business,
and of our approach to risk identification and management.

There are three supply chain-specific metrics that help inform
on the effectiveness of our human rights and modern slavery
programme. These are, key suppliers:

This year, we ran an internal workshop aimed at encouraging
participants to consider how modern slavery might impact
their role. It was run in partnership with Stronger Together
and attended by representatives from across the business,
including procurement, internal services, risk, compliance
and sanctions. We also hosted a webinar for our key
suppliers as part of our commitment made last year to raise
awareness of their obligations to the MSA. This was
co-developed and presented with the Business and Human
Rights Resource Centre, to communicate our expectation of
standards and share best practice examples.
Next, we plan to develop human rights and modern slavery
training materials, accessible to all staff, so that they can
update their knowledge and understanding of these issues in
society and business.

••

••

responding to our annual supplier survey (FY18: 82%,
FY17: 81%)
with sustainability in commercial arrangements (FY18:
72%, FY17: 62%)
with a human rights/modern slavery policy (FY18: 72%,
FY17: 66%)

For each of these KPIs we have a commitment to achieve
80%, as a minimum.
The year-on-year increase in these KPIs demonstrates that
our supplier engagement programme is having a positive
impact.

We acknowledge that a policy alone does not uphold human
rights standards in a business. However, we believe it acts
as a stimulus to initiate internal conversations and a review
of current practices, leading to improvements in due course.
We also use a broad set of metrics to monitor our human
rights and modern slavery performance, both in our
operations and supply chain.
For example, an extensive set of measures relating to the
wellbeing, diversity and inclusion of our people allows us to
actively manage these aspects of our business throughout
the year. We also report on our performance publicly in our
Annual Report and our Non-financial Performance
Scorecard.

Moreover, 100% of our identified high risk suppliers have a
modern slavery statement or human rights policy, which
gives us confidence that they are proactive in identifying and
minimising risks on our behalf.

Our commitments
In our last statement we committed to a number of actions. We feel we have made good progress towards these, with all of them either completed
or ‘on-track’ but there is more to do. Below is a summary of our actions to date and new commitments we are making for the coming year, to help
us continue to make headway on this important topic.

Kuwait Petroleum International Aviation Co. Ltd. (the Company) is committed to ensuring that there are no
acts of modern slavery within its own business or within its supply chains. We acknowledge our responsibility
to the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and will work to ensure transparency within the organisation and with
suppliers of goods and services to the organisation.
The Company is part of a state owned enterprise that markets jet fuel to customers at airports worldwide. We
have business relationships with other group companies and with external businesses for supplying jet fuel.
These, as well as the suppliers of various other products and services, form our supply chains.
As part of our diligence process into slavery and human trafficking, the key supplier approval process will
incorporate a review of the controls undertaken by our suppliers. Included in the supply chain are imported
products from sources outside of the EU that are potentially more at risk for slavery and human trafficking
issues, and therefore management resources will be especially focused on those areas.
The Company will not support of deal with any business knowingly involved in slavery and human trafficking.
The senior management team has been trained in the subject of modern slavery and has been closely involved
in the due diligence process, producing a comprehensive gap analysis and attending workshops. All other staff
have been made aware of the Company policy and statement.
The Company’s directors and senior management will take the responsibility of implementing this policy and
will provide adequate resources and investment to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking
place within the organisation and its supply chains.
This statement will be reviewed annually and published in our annual report and on our internet site.

Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2019-20
The information in this Statement is made pursuant to the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 (“the Act”) and
relates to the financial year ended 31 March 2020.

Introduction
Kuwait Petroleum International Limited (""the Company""), known by our trademark Q8, is committed to
ensuring that there are no acts of modern day slavery or human trafficking within our own operations or
within our supply chains.

About us
The Company is an international subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, Kuwait's national oil
company (""KPC"").
The Company provides management and consultancy services to affiliates and subsidiaries (""group
companies""). The Company performs activities in three main locations: UK, Netherlands and Kuwait. The
Company is not directly engaged in business activities with external customers.

COVID-19 pandemic
The current outbreak of a novel coronavirus (""COVID-19""), which has been declared a global pandemic
by the World Health Organization, has slightly delayed the publication of this Statement due, in part, to
office closures and reduced staff capacity.
The Company has implemented extraordinary measures to safeguard personnel and to prevent the
spread of the virus including shift patterns to make social distancing easier, restricted workplace access,
temperature checks at entry points and an evacuation process for any suspected cases. The Company
has also identified personnel who fall into vulnerable groups and provides support for fulltime remote
working.
The Company continues to support its personnel and suppliers at our offices with frequent information
updates and training. We carry out regular deep cleaning and sanitation, and personnel are provided
with personal protective equipment. The Company has also ensured suppliers are paid in accordance
with their contracts during these difficult times.
The Company will continue to monitor developments and, where necessary, undertake new risk
assessments or reconsider the prioritisation of previously identified risks.

Structure and supply chains
This Statement covers our direct operations and supply chain activity. We have business relationships
with group companies and a few external suppliers in relation to consultancy, training, advisory and
management services.

All group companies must comply with local legislation and regulations, and must conduct their activities
in line with the KPC Code of Conduct and our core values, which includes integrity. We expect our
contractors and suppliers to comply with all applicable laws and the principles of the Code of Conduct.
Some of our suppliers may have their own supply chains and we encourage them to follow our
expectations in relation to ethical business conduct.

Policies on modern slavery
In our Code of Conduct and related ethical business policies, and as further described in our sustainability
report and CSR guidelines, the Company ensures that it provides a safe place to work. The Company will
not support, condone or deal with any business knowingly involved in practices such as slavery and/or
human trafficking. The immediate steps we took in regards to reducing the spread of COVID-19 provide
good evidence of our commitment to the safety and wellbeing of people.

Due diligence processes
The Company relies on established supplier approval processes and procurement related processes. We
are asking potential suppliers to review and acknowledge the Code of Conduct.
In Kuwait, the government grants licences to local companies who meet set qualification criteria, which
allows them to operate. The Kuwait oil sector also provides minimum labour and welfare conditions for
personnel, which KPI strongly supports. The Company considers these verification processes and checks
significantly reduce the risks of the Company contracting with unscrupulous suppliers.
We continue to update contractual templates, which are issued to our supply chain. We are also
reviewing the insertion of provisions specifically referring to human trafficking legislation. We have
identified that janitor services and or services procured outside of the EU pose a higher risk for slavery
and human trafficking issues. Senior management are aware of such risks and take greater care and
scrutiny in relation to approving such suppliers.

Risk assessment
We actively monitor risk; however, forced or involuntary labour continues to remain unlikely within our
own operations given we recruit and employ professional and technical specialists to carry out
management services.
In relation to our supply chain, we have identified that suppliers providing cleaning, catering and or
facilities management services to our offices, particularly branches outside the EU present a higher risk.
We also anticipate increased risks where suppliers seem reluctant to share compliance procedures or
provide contractual assurances.
In our Kuwait office, we have recently observed that the Government has taken an increasingly active
and robust approach to the prevention of human trafficking, which has been particularly evident during
the COVID-19 pandemic – this should go some way in mitigating the risk of trafficked workers appearing
in our Kuwait supply chains.

Monitoring our effectiveness
The Company’s Legal Compliance Committee, reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer, is
responsible for the various compliance and regulatory risks facing the Company. This team actively
monitors, provides guidance and shares advice on a variety of topics including compliance with the Act.
The Company’s directors and senior management will take the responsibility of implementing our
policies and principles, and they will provide adequate resources and investment to ensure that slavery
and human trafficking is not taking place within the organisation and its supply chains
We regularly review the effectiveness of our policies and processes, and will continue increasing the
awareness of our personnel. We are making progress with an internal standalone ‘Modern Slavery Policy’
and are considering publication.

Training
Senior managers as well as key personnel in our Kuwait head office, have been trained in the subject of
Modern Slavery and have been involved in the due diligence process and attending workshops. All other
staff have been made aware of the relevant Company policies and Statement. We provide refresher
online training and continue to investigate new ways to increase awareness.
This Statement will be reviewed annually and published on our website normally within 6 months of our
financial year-end.

Blackhawk Network, Inc. (Arizona, USA)
Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking
Statement
This statement is made pursuant to the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (UK) and the Modern Slavery Act 2018
(Cth) (Australia), and constitutes our modern slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year
ending December 2019. We are committed to operating our business lawfully and ethically and in only
working with suppliers that are aligned to our values. We expect our suppliers to operate in accordance with
all applicable modern slavery laws including those prohibiting human slavery and slavery like practices,
human trafficking and child labour. We value and observe all laws regarding corporate social responsibility,
environmental and workplace safety protection and staff inclusion and diversity. We have a whistle-blower
policy and an external hotline for staff and suppliers to use.
Our Structure
Blackhawk Network Holdings, Inc. (Delaware, USA) is a privately-owned, US company headquartered in
Pleasanton, CA with over 3,000 employees worldwide and operations in 28 countries. We deliver branded
payment programs to help meet today’s most challenging business objectives. We collaborate with our
partners to innovate, translating market trends in branded payments to extend reach, build loyalty and
increase revenue.
We offer a portfolio of comprehensive services to help ensure the success of our partners’ branded
payment programs, including design, distribution, fulfilment and marketing.
Our Supply Chains
Our supply chain operations relate to the production and fulfilment of physical gift cards, technology
partners that support back-end payment processing, merchandise provided by various retailers for loyalty,
award, and promotion purposes, and suppliers that directly support our day-to-day administrative functions.
Due to the nature of our business and that of our supply chain, we have assessed that there is very low risk
of modern slavery and human trafficking. Nevertheless, we have implemented a number of processes and
controls to further limit the risk of slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our
business. The relationships with most of our suppliers have been established over a number of years and
have been built on integrity and mutual trust. We conduct due diligence on suppliers through research at the
initial set up phase, by including relevant clauses in contracts, and sending questionnaires to suppliers. We
monitor the outputs of these and take appropriate action when we believe it is necessary.
Our Policies
Our Supplier Code of Conduct details what we expect from our suppliers with regards to:
Business Practices and Ethics

Labour Practices and Human Rights
Environmental Protection

Environmental Protection

Compliance and Reporting
We encourage our suppliers to require their subcontractors to acknowledge and implement equivalent
standards of conduct.
We have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. This Code serves to guide the actions of our employees

consistent with the values of Blackhawk Network. The Code emphasises our commitment to doing business
responsibly, ethically and honestly. This is about more than staying out of the headlines and avoiding legal
issues – it’s about fostering a workplace that values trust, quality and fairness within the company, and with

our customers, suppliers and business partners. Our Code outlines principles to help employees do the
right thing and encourages employees to speak up and report any Code violations that they see or suspect.
We also have a process for all employees and external partners to be able to report a ‘Serious Incident’,
which includes any concerns over slavery and human trafficking.
Our Training
We train all employees on relevant legislative requirements which impact our business. We regularly
communicate our company policies through our intranet, and roll out relevant training courses annually,
which include training specific to Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking
Future Commitments
1. Expanding our Supplier Code of Conduct to all regions where we operate.

CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT (SB 657)
On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) went into effect in the State of California. Under the law, large
manufacturers and retailers are required to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking within their supply chains. The law’s underlying
purpose is to educate consumers, so they can make informed decisions and purchase goods from companies that responsibly manage their supply chains.

VERIFICATION
We are committed to fair labor practices within our supply chain. We engage in regular efforts to identify, assess and manage the risks of human trafficking in the
production of our products. When we partner with suppliers we evaluate human trafficking risks based on a variety of factors, including an in-person visit at their
site, the suppliers’ geographical location and manufacturing process, a workforce profile and the history of human trafficking and slavery in the sector. We do not
use third-party verifiers. Our own risk-management team spearheads the verification process using an internally developed rubric and multi-part assessment. Our
risk-management team is currently unable to verify whether our subcontractors use labor brokers.

AUDITS
Our internal audit team regularly conducts announced audits of our direct suppliers to evaluate their compliance with our anti-slavery and human trafficking
company standards. Audits consist of individual and group interviews with supervisors and management, as well as facility tours.

CERTIFICATION
To ensure that our contractors and suppliers respect and enforce our company standards, our agreements require the contractors and suppliers to certify that
they “will comply with all applicable local, state and federal laws and will not employ children, prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor or use corporal
punishment or other forms of mention and physical coercion as a form of discipline. In the absence of any national or local law, an individual of less than 15 years
of age is considered a child. If local laws set the minimum age below 15 years of age, but is in accordance with exceptions under the International Labor
Organization Convention 138, the lower age will apply.” We also reserve the right to request the contractors and suppliers provide documentation to show
compliance with its obligations.

INTERNAL ACCOUNTABILITY
We have developed internal accountability standards and procedures for employees and contractors failing to meet our company standards regarding slavery and
trafficking. If and when our company uncovers employee or contractor compliance problems, we provide written notice and a specified period of time to take
corrective action.

TRAINING
Our company does not provide employees or contractors with training on human trafficking and slavery, but are currently establishing training protocols to be
implemented.

MODERN SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF THE FINANCIAL
YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2019
Introduction
This statement is issued by Mediclinic International plc (the “Company” or “Mediclinic”) in respect of
the financial year ended 31 March 2019 (“FY19”) and marks the fourth statement issued by the
Company.
This statement confirms Mediclinic’s continued commitment to prevent modern slavery and human
trafficking in the workplace, as well as its supply chain, and sets out the steps the Company has taken
to prevent any form of such practices, in its business, or indirectly through its supply chain. During
FY19, Mediclinic developed and implemented supplementary measures to strengthen its position in
monitoring slavery and human trafficking activities. No material incidents of modern slavery, human
trafficking or any violation of human rights were observed or reported on throughout Mediclinic and its
subsidiaries (the “Group”).
Our business
Mediclinic, with its primary listing on the London Stock Exchange (“LSE”), is an international private
healthcare group with divisions in Switzerland, Southern Africa (South Africa and Namibia) and the
United Arab Emirates. Mediclinic is focused on providing specialist-orientated, multi-disciplinary
services across the continuum of care. The Group’s core purpose is to enhance the quality of life by
providing comprehensive, high-quality healthcare services in such a way that the Group will be
regarded as the most respected and trusted provider of healthcare services by patients, medical
practitioners and funders of healthcare in each of its markets. For further information on the Mediclinic
business and its divisions, visit www.mediclinic.com.
Ethical foundation and policies
Ethical behaviour is a fundamental guiding principle and management continuously focus on
establishing a culture of responsibility, fairness, honesty, accountability and transparency across the
Group. Our stakeholders, which include our employees, patients, supporting medical practitioners,
shareholders, suppliers, society and community, healthcare funders and government, rightfully expect
that the Group stands for honesty and integrity in all its decisions and actions. The Company’s
commitment to sound ethical relations with all its stakeholders forms part of the Group’s values and is
of fundamental importance.
Mediclinic’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Ethics Code”) specifically prohibits, in relation
to employees, child, forced and/or compulsory labour. It also confirms the Group’s commitment to treat
employees fairly, with respect to their human rights and dignity. The Ethics Code further provides, that
suppliers (and other business advisors and associates), as far as practical and reasonably possible,
are evaluated on human rights prior to procurement or other agreements and uphold the same ethical
standards as Mediclinic. The Ethics Code also confirms that the Group shall act in accordance with all
applicable legislation of the jurisdictions in which it conducts business. As part of its responsibility to
respect human rights, the Ethics Code confirms its commitment to circumvent, and not contribute, to
any indirect adverse human rights impact that is directly linked to the Group’s operations or services
by our suppliers or other business relations.
Training and overview of our KPIs
The Mediclinic Board of Directors (the “Board”), as well as all relevant employees, particularly
employees managing the supply chain across the Group, have been informed about the regulatory
requirements to ensure an understanding of the risks, the Group’s position on slavery and human
trafficking, to manage those risks accordingly and to further stay abreast of global developments in this
regard. This information forms part of the induction programme for all new Board members and
relevant employees. Recognising that the greatest risk lies within the supply chain, awareness training
is scheduled on an annual basis with all procurement business units within the Group as well as new

recruits in order to make employees and suppliers aware of the reality of modern slavery and to
provide sufficient means to combat any such activities they might encounter.
Recruitment
During the period, human resource employees were informed of and requested to assist in the
elimination of human trafficking and any form of modern slavery within human resource practices by
sharing this information with their teams to create further awareness in the workplace and by reporting
any such instances. Awareness has been created among line managers of the importance of this
reality, especially in the Group’s hiring practices.
Supply chain management
The reporting period saw a focus on the continued development of the monitoring of Mediclinic’s
supply chain, which consists of a diverse group of local and international suppliers. For Mediclinic to
deliver its services and continuously improve its patients’ experience, it is dependent on a large
number of diverse suppliers that form an integral part of the Group’s ability to provide quality
healthcare. The Group relies on its suppliers to deliver superior products and services that conform to
the Mediclinic values and standards. The suppliers are engaged to appreciate the Company’s
expectations and expected to adhere to the Group’s applicable policies.
Several criteria play a role in selecting suppliers, inter alia, compliance with relevant labour legislation
such as health and safety legislation, compliance with applicable local and international standards, the
stability of the organisation and the reputation of the relevant equipment brand. Once selected,
monthly review of global contracts are performed to track performance.
Other factors that were considered in selecting new suppliers or reviewing the contractual relationship
with existing suppliers during the reporting period, are:
•
•
•
•
•

the values of key suppliers which must be aligned to those of Mediclinic, including their views on
human rights;
ethical behavior, transparency and compliance which forms the cornerstone of the relationships
with suppliers;
suppliers must have the same approach towards transparency as Mediclinic;
long-term relationships are built with suppliers based on mutual trust and respect; and
all procurement is effected in support of the creation and maintenance of a safe and legally
compliant environment.

In Southern Africa, the broad-based black economic empowerment status of a supplier is a key
consideration in the selection process.
Due to the geographic diversity of the Group’s operations and the potential for cost saving and
improved efficiency, Mediclinic drives international procurement initiatives with the aim of unlocking
synergies and implementing standardisation for the greater benefit of the Group. Medical Innovations
(Pty) Ltd (“Medical Innovations”), a wholly owned South African subsidiary of the Company, was
established to attend to the innovation, purchasing and distribution of medical supplies and related
1
products. It achieved the internationally accepted ISO 13485:2016 certification during 2016, which
remains valid. The certification audit was performed and awarded by BSI, an organisation based in the
United Kingdom. Formal agreements with critical suppliers as well as supplier selection evaluation is a
key focus area in the ISO certification process. Medical Innovations complies with all local regulations
and is registered with the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority to import and export
medical devices and consumable products.
The Group selects manufacturers that have a proven track record, with their factories predominantly
situated in China, India and Malaysia. Certain suppliers’ premises, located in geographic areas that
are considered high risk areas for instances of modern slavery and human trafficking, are physically
visited, inspected and audited by Mediclinic employees, prior to procurement contracts being
concluded.
Currently the majority of the supply chain is required to conform to the following supply chain criteria:
1

ISO13485:2016 specifies requirements for a quality management system where an organisation needs to demonstrate its
ability to provide medical devices and related services that consistently meet customer and applicable regulatory
requirements. This certification process has a specific section relating to supplier selection and contracting.

•
•
•
•
•

ISO 9000 and/or ISO 13485 quality management certification;
relevant ISO certification of the products utilised;
2
3
CE and/or FDA certification;
compliance to all relevant local regulations, including applicable labour legislation; and
new technologies introduced to the Group must be supported by credible health technology
assessments.

A new Group Supply Chain Risk Management Policy is now operational. The purpose of this policy is
to ensure that the Group maintains a reliable supply chain, and that reputable service providers and
safe products are utilised in all of its facilities. It provides the framework to identify, assess, and
mitigate supply chain risks, and to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and laws in all
jurisdictions in which it operates.
Due diligence and risk assessment
Mediclinic has subscribed to the Thomson Reuters World Check risk management solution tool to
perform screening in respect of the top 25 global surgical and top 15 global capital suppliers, which
represents approximately 70% of the total Group procurement spend in these categories. This tool
assists the procurement team by screening suppliers and providing alerts should any information
regarding undesirable business practices of a supplier be recorded. To date, no alerts were received
through this screening process.
A revised and updated due diligence questionnaire was sent to key suppliers of the Company during
the reporting period, to pro-actively assess risks relating to, inter alia, human rights, transparency and
awareness, aimed at establishing further insight into the veracity of modern slavery and human
trafficking. Positive responses were received from our multi-national suppliers indicating their initiatives
to eliminate all risks relating to violations of human rights in their organisation, as well as their supply
chain.
Representatives of the Group procurement department visited the factories of five key manufacturers
situated in high-risk jurisdictions during the reporting period, in order to assess the operations. These
representatives were equipped with the requisite information pertaining to modern slavery and related
activities, the identification of signs of worker exploitation and the manner in which to report any such
instances. The Group also engaged its linen suppliers to raise their awareness on these aspects and
to confirm that their sources of imported raw cotton material have been audited. No steps were
required to be taken towards suppliers as they all met the required standards to the representatives’
reasonable knowledge and belief.
Mediclinic encourages its suppliers to conform to the international trend of eliminating human
trafficking and modern slavery. Should certain suppliers require training on modern slavery and human
trafficking, assistance and guidance will be provided in order for the suppliers to improve their related
practices. Mediclinic employees that are involved in the purchasing of equipment or consumables are
also bound to strict ethical principles ensuring that a high standard of integrity is maintained in the
Group’s supplier relationships. During a global procurement meeting where the senior procurement
team members from all divisions were present, the current supply chain was assessed and training
was provided to increase awareness and identify potential areas of risk.
Moving forward
Mediclinic does not tolerate any form of human rights violations and is committed to continuously
ensuring that no form of modern slavery or human trafficking occurs in any part of its operations. It
recognises the responsibility to eliminate illegal practices that encroach and infringe upon human
rights, as well as the need to respond to the reality of modern slavery.

2

CE marking is a certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for
products sold within the European Economic Area (“EEA”). The CE marking is also found on products sold outside the EEA
that are manufactured in, or designed to be sold in, the EEA. Manufacturing standards and labour practices are considered in
this certification process.

3

Companies exporting products from the United States are often asked by foreign customers or foreign governments to supply
a certificate for products regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The certificate is prepared by FDA
containing information about the product's regulatory or marketing status. All aspects of manufacturing are considered in this
process, including labour practices.

The Group’s anonymous toll-free ethics lines, which are managed by an independent service provider,
are available to all employees, suppliers or any third party who wish to report a concern that requires
further investigation. All reports are dealt with in a non-discriminatory and confidential manner. Any
form of retaliation against an employee or other person making a report in good faith will not be
tolerated by the Group.
Objectives for the next financial year:
•
•

•

the implementation of all aspects of the Group Supply Chain Policy, across the Group, will be
monitored by way of performing internal audits;
an annual due diligence questionnaire is sent to key suppliers of the Group to pro-actively
assess risks relating to, inter alia, human rights violations and to improve transparency, create
awareness and provide further insight into the reality of modern slavery and human trafficking.
This questionnaire will also form part of the minimum criteria during the on-boarding of new
suppliers;
continue to promote awareness within the divisions and provide the necessary training to key
staff members on the reality of modern slavery and human trafficking and recognising and, most
importantly, reporting such incidents, and continue actively to consider trends and current
practices on preventing modern slavery and human trafficking as well as recommendations
developed by governments.

partnership incorporated under
English law. In some jurisdictions we
practise through this partnership, in
others through a local entity which
uses the Clifford Chance name. Our
practices are supported by a number
of wholly-owned service companies.
The members, shareholders, partners
and directors of all these entities are
subject to the governance of Clifford
Chance LLP. Each of the 32 offices is
managed locally by one of our senior
partners, supported by professional
managers and experts as appropriate.
For more information about us, our
business and our structure, see Who
we are and how we work.
Our supply chains relate to our global
office-based professional service
business – supplying personnel,
goods and services to support the
services we in turn provide to our
clients. Some of our suppliers are
local while others are engaged on a
global scale. We seek to establish
and maintain relationships with our
suppliers with a view to ensuring that
all elements of our supply chain act in
accordance with our Supplier Code,
applicable laws, our values and ethical
business principles.

POLICIES
Clifford Chance has a global policy on
modern slavery and human trafficking
which states:
Clifford Chance opposes all forms of
slavery and human trafficking, and
we are committed to taking steps to
ensure that these do not occur in our
business or in our supply chains.

Clifford Chance is built around
strong values and ethical business
principles and we expect all our
undertakings to be conducted in an
honest, fair and transparent manner.
Our approach to modern slavery is
reinforced by our employment and
labour policies relating to diversity,
dignity and inclusiveness. We
support the government’s recent
statements (see 2017 UK Annual
Report on Modern Slavery) about
the importance of this issue, and
we are committed to take steps to
ensure there is no modern slavery in
our business or supply chains. In our
firm we create a safe, healthy and
inclusive workplace with a strong
culture of collaboration and respect
for others. For some of our practices
and initiatives, see Responsible
Business and our 2016 Modern
Slavery Act Transparency Statement.
Clifford Chance aims to be a leader
in corporate responsibility among
our peers. We promote ethical
values and adhere to all applicable
laws in all jurisdictions in which we
operate. We are actively committed
to the UN Global Compact’s 10
principles and our global human
rights policy states our support and
respect of internationally recognised
human rights. We report annually
on our compliance in the core
areas of human rights, labour, the
environment and anti-corruption: see
our Responsible Business report and
Global Reporting Index.
In June 2017 we were involved in
a peer review of our 2016 Modern
Slavery Act Transparency Statement
with other business members of
the United Nations Global Compact
UK Network. We have applied
feedback from that review and will
now develop and implement further

key performance indicators as part
of our anti-modern slavery policy and
programme. We also took part in a
peer learning process attended by
a number of international law firms
at which emerging best practice for
governance and reporting under the
Modern Slavery Act was discussed.
In July 2017 we appointed a member
of the central Compliance team
to oversee our Modern Slavery
programme to ensure that we deliver
on our commitments.

DUE DILIGENCE AND
RISK ASSESSMENT
As a professional services firm strictly
regulated by professional regulatory
bodies in each of the jurisdictions
in which we operate, and in the
light of our global employment and
ethical policies and practices, we
have assessed that we are at low
risk of slavery or human trafficking
existing within our own business,
although we are alert to the possible
risks and prepared to address any
that may arise. We consider there
is a greater risk of slavery or human
trafficking occurring within our supply
chains (suppliers of personnel, goods
and services).
We acknowledge that slavery and
human trafficking exist in many
jurisdictions in which we operate,
and/or from which we procure goods
or services. Our approach to due
diligence of modern slavery risks
extends to both our business and
our supply chains.
In relation to our supply chains:
n Our policy is to perform due
diligence on all new suppliers;
n We carry out annual reviews of all
our major suppliers;
n Where we identify a higher risk
of modern slavery we implement
necessary enhanced checks.

In July 2016 we initiated a process
to identify any current concerns
or suspicions of modern slavery in
our network. Our Office Managing
Partners and General Managers
were provided with guidance on the
process, including the ILO Indicators
of Forced Labour and red flags
used to determine whether a worker
could be a victim of modern slavery.
In the guidance, we outlined the
process of initial reports whereby
concerns or suspicions of modern
slavery should be made. In August
2016, all offices were requested to
make a preliminary assessment of
their suppliers, subcontractors and
supply chains to determine if any
office might directly or indirectly be
associated with any suppliers which
could be particularly susceptible to
slavery or human trafficking. As part
of their review, each office took into
account the Global Slavery Index
which measures vulnerability to
enslavement worldwide.
In August 2016 we also carried out a
central risk assessment of the firm’s
top 100 suppliers, taking the Global
Slavery Index into consideration with
regards to locations where the supplier
performed their services, or had
connections to. In September 2016
we centrally assessed these suppliers
for any recorded human rights issues.
A key objective for the next reporting
period is to enhance our ongoing
due diligence process for both
our business risks and our supply
chain risks with active involvement
of compliance, procurement and
HR teams. For example, we are
developing a central risk based
assessment of our offices and, based
on priorities emerging from that, will
implement a programme of annual
review of a sample of offices each
year. In addition, we will include
questions relating to modern slavery in
the firm’s annual risk review process.

PROCUREMENT PROCESSES
Clifford Chance’s Supplier Code is
available on our website and sets out
the standard of conduct we expect
from all our suppliers and contractors
worldwide and which covers slavery
and human trafficking. We require all
our suppliers to comply with this code
of conduct.
Our supplier questionnaires help
us to assess the risk of slavery and
human trafficking in the business
and supply chains of a proposed
supplier prior to entering into any
new supply relationships and are
also applied prior to the renewal
of existing supplier contracts. In
the reporting period we enhanced
those questionnaires to address
modern slavery issues in greater
detail. We also began to implement
new contractual provisions requiring
suppliers to comply with our Supplier
Code, and allowing us to ensure that
appropriate additional language goes
into every new supplier contract, and
every current supplier contract as and
when it is renewed, which,
n as standard, requires the supplier
to ensure that no slavery is used
anywhere in its business or in its
supply chain, and enables us to
terminate the contract for breach of
this requirement; and
n in the case of any supplier
contracts deemed higher-risk, also
requires the supplier (a) to establish
necessary processes and policies
to ensure that no slavery is used
anywhere in its business or in its
supply chain, and (b) contractually
entitles us to request further
information we may need to verify
compliance, and enables us to
terminate the contract if these
requirements were to be breached.
We will take further steps to promote
awareness of and monitor progress
in the implementation of these new
contractual requirements in the
next reporting period. We intend to
CLIFFORD CHANCE | 2

implement additional due diligence
questionnaires and associated
follow-up processes for suppliers
found to have higher associated
risks of slavery. The next stage in
the development of our procurement
policy in this area would be to
develop more detailed guidelines on
addressing modern slavery issues
when they arise. Our appointment
of a modern slavery champion in
the area of procurement seeks to
coordinate our efforts in these areas.

EFFECTIVENESS
We assess the effectiveness of the
steps we are taking to address
modern slavery through a number
of performance indicators including
(1) number of people trained and
feedback from training; and
(2) the number of reported instances
of concerns about possible modern
slavery/trafficking issues.
As part of our documented Supplier
Relationship Framework, we annually
review, and meet with, our major
global suppliers and we intend to
ensure that modern slavery is always
included in future discussions. Having
implemented enhanced modern
slavery measures from within our

procurement processes, we will
seek feedback during our annual risk
processes with suppliers that will help
us to enhance our measures and the
communication of our requirements.
Supplier feedback will also form
an important tool in identifying,
assessing and addressing modern
slavery risk.

TRAINING, AWARENESS AND
CAPACITY BUILDING
We are committed to ensuring
that our people are equipped to
identify risk factors and indicators
of possible slavery and human
trafficking and we are taking steps
to raise awareness around the
implications of the Modern Slavery
Act for our business. For example,
in August 2016 Clifford Chance
was the first international law firm to
sign up to the Fair Hiring Pledge, an
initiative which provides training on
the fair hiring of migrant domestic
staff in Hong Kong to help avoid
practices such as modern slavery.
We have implemented a mandatory
training module for all our lawyers,
including all our partners, in relation
to the issues the Modern Slavery
Act raises for Clifford Chance and its

business. This course is mandatory
for all new lawyers when joining the
firm and we intend to make this
training mandatory for all our people
within the next reporting period. We
have implemented targeted training
for teams involved in procurement,
human resources and client clearance
in relation to issues relevant to their
particular areas of work. Our aim is
that this training should enhance our
ability to identify and address risks,
communicate our expectations and
build anti-slavery capacity within our
supply chains.
Through our policies and the training
we implement, we seek to ensure
that relevant decision-makers within
core functions, such as procurement
and human resources are provided
with a level of knowledge and
understanding that will effectively
address modern slavery risks and
that all of our people are alert to
possible risks. We intend now to
supplement our policies, processes
and training to include more detailed
guidance on how our people should
address indicators or instances of
modern slavery when identified.

This statement is made by Clifford Chance LLP on behalf of itself and those entities which operate as part of the
Clifford Chance group, and are subject to the governance of Clifford Chance LLP (“Clifford Chance”).

Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking
Statement
The Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “MSA”), requires companies, which carry on business in the UK and have
a global turnover of over £36 million, to disclose information detailing how they are tackling slavery and
human trafficking in their supply chain. Shaftesbury is committed to ensuring, as far as possible, that our own
business and our supply chain are aware of and addresses these issues.
Shaftesbury respects international principles of human rights and has been a signatory of the UN Global
Compact since 2015. This is our fourth annual slavery and human trafficking statement and sets out the
activities we have undertaken to take to prevent, as far as practical, modern slavery and human trafficking in
our business and supply chain during the year ended 30 September 2019.

OUR BUSINESS
Shaftesbury is a FTSE 250 listed company which operates solely in the UK, investing in real estate in
London’s West End. At 30 September 2019, our portfolio was valued at £3.99 billion and comprised nearly
600 buildings across 15 acres and a mix of uses.

Whilst we have a small team of 34 employees, Shaftesbury has an extensive external supply chain. We see
our main risks within the scope of this legislation as relating to the procurement of materials and labour
services connected with building refurbishment projects and property management. We contract with a
number of suppliers in these activities.

We are dedicated to ensuring that our employees and out-sourced providers are aware of the legislation and
are actively working together to tackle modern slavery and human trafficking risks.

OUR POLICIES AND TRAINING

We have policies in place within our business which set out our approach to these issues. These are available
on our website at: www.shaftesbury.co.uk

Human rights
We support the ten principles of the UN Global Compact on human rights, labour, environment and anticorruption. Our key policy goals include adhering to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International
Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and
Rights at Work. Our Environmental, Social and Governance Policy, which is aligned to the UN Sustainable
Development Goals, and documents our commitment to treat our staff and suppliers with fairness, dignity
and respect, and to support the protection of internationally recognised human rights. This policy was
approved by the Board in 2019.

Health and Safety policy
We provide and maintain safe and healthy working conditions, regularly monitor the management of our health
and safety at work and make regular equipment safety inspections. Any health and safety incidents are
notified to the Company Secretary immediately.

Whistleblowing policy
We encourage all employees to report any serious concerns that they may have with regard to wrongdoing or
criminal activity related to any aspect of their work, the conduct of others or the running of our company
including activities carried out on behalf of the company, for example by managing agents.
The policy also covers reporting any activity which is perceived as a risk of modern slavery or human
trafficking.
Employees, contractors or suppliers who become aware of possible improper, unethical or illegal behaviour
are encouraged to report any concerns, through using the Whistleblower’s Helpline operated by ExpoLink:

Telephone: 0800 374 199
Website: https://wrs.expolink.co.uk/shaftesbury
App: SpeakingUp (available through the Apple App Store and Google Play for Android).
Access code: Shaftesbury

Anti-bullying and harassment policy
We operate a strict policy preventing unwanted conduct which would affect the dignity of any employee in the
workplace. Offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour which, through the abuse or misuse of
power, makes the recipient feel vulnerable, upset, humiliated or threatened is unacceptable.

Training
Training is undertaken with employees and first tier suppliers and we have provided ongoing guidance through
our annual sustainability training and awareness session.
All our employees receive compliance training which includes specific reference to slavery and human
trafficking, and in particular the risks our supply chain is faced with.

WITHIN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
Our supply chain is extensive as we have many outsourced service providers working on our behalf including
direct suppliers such as legal advisors and property managers as well as indirect suppliers which includes for

example cleaning, security and suppliers of materials and labour in refurbishment projects. All of the policies,
referred to above, are available on our website alongside our Environmental, Social and Governance Policy,
which is provided annually to each key business within our supply chain, to encourage them, at a minimum, to
adopt and enforce similar policies in their own business.
Based on our annual risk assessment, we believe the business overall has a low risk of modern slavery in
both our own operations and in our immediate supply chain. However, we are pro-active in ensuring we are
making our workforce, sub-contractors and suppliers aware of areas of potential risk and we are working to
raise awareness and monitoring processes.
In 2017 we developed a Supplier Code of Conduct, which was reviewed and updated in 2018. This document
has been circulated to our principal suppliers for inclusion in contracts throughout our supply chain and is
available on our website: www.shaftesbury.co.uk
This includes our whistleblowing helpline details which is available for use by our suppliers.
All new suppliers are now required to acknowledge that they will conform with our Supplier Code of Conduct.
Through our tendering and contracting procedures, suppliers are required to uphold the requirements of the
Supplier Code of Conduct and ensure any subcontractors they appoint do the same. These obligations are
reflected in our contractual documentation.
All advisers and contractors must adhere to the labour standards required by us which include requiring the
payment of the London living wage, as a minimum for London based employees, and ensuring that all
suppliers and contractors never use forced, compulsory or child labour. In support of this, during 2018 we
became accredited ‘Living Wage Employers’ by the Living Wage Foundation and have retained our
accreditation during 2019.
Advisers and contractors are also required to have regard to current UK environmental and health and safety
legislation. They are required to provide comfortable working conditions for employees involved in the
refurbishment projects and use construction materials reputably sourced with recognised certification for the
projects.
All refurbishment contractors are required to register with the Considerate Constructors Scheme (CCS) a nonprofit making organisation designed to encourage best practice in areas including, environmental, safety,
community and workforce welfare. By registering with the CCS the contractors commit to providing a workplace
where everyone is respected and treated fairly and are subject to third part audit to verify that this is the
case. During 2019, all our sites exceeded the minimum compliance requirements of 25 out of 50 with an
improved year on year average score of 38 (2018: 35.6).
We continue to raise awareness on our refurbishment project sites through use of Stronger2gether posters
and updates within our annual sustainability workshops attended by our project managers, managing agents
and principal contractors that work on our portfolio.

LOOKING FORWARD
During 2020, we will continue to address the risks identified above and seek opportunities to further reduce
the risk of human trafficking and modern slavery throughout our business operations and supply chain. As
part of this commitment we will do the following:
• We will maintain our accreditation with the Living Wage Foundation. We will review and update our Supplier
Code of Conduct and monitor its implementation and inclusion in all contracts within the supply chain.
• Continue to ensure that all our employees are trained on the MSA, highlighting key signs and indicators that
someone may be a victim of modern slavery.
This statement is in compliance with section 54 MSA and relates to Shaftesbury PLC and all its subsidiaries.

It is made in respect of its financial year ended 30 September 2019 and will be reviewed and updated to
outline our progress, achievements and new targets for the year ending 30 September 2020.
Approved by the Board on 30 January 2020.

EXPLANATION OF TERMS
‘Hidden Labour Exploitation’ is exploitation of job applicants or workers by third party individuals or
gangs other than the employer or labour provider including rogue individuals working within these
businesses but without the knowledge of management. It includes forced labour and human trafficking for
labour exploitation; payment for work-finding services and work-related exploitation such as forced use of

Policy.

It is the responsibility of each individual member of staff to familiarise themselves with this procedure and to
ensure their own compliance at all times.

POLICY
Lactalis commits to developing and adopting a proactive approach to tackling hidden labour exploitation by:
•

Providing the HR Managers with the necessary training to have responsibility for developing and
operating Company procedures relevant to this issue.

•

Accepting that job finding fees are a business cost, and will not allow these to be paid by job applicants.
The Company will not use any individual or organisation to source and supply workers without
confirming that workers are not being charged a work finding fee.

•

Ensuring that all staff responsible for directly recruiting workers are aware of issues around third party
labour exploitation and signs to look for and adhere to the relevant Company policies at all times.

trusted and competent HR Managers and Line Managers.

•

Adopting a proactive approach to reporting suspicions of hidden worker exploitation to the Gangmasters
Licensing Authority and police.

Provide information on tackling “Hidden Labour Exploitation” to our workforce in a variety of formats,
including the display of workplace posters, worker leaflets, holding Manager briefings and including
information in induction training sessions.

•

Encouraging workers to report cases of hidden third party labour exploitation, providing the means to do
so and investigating and acting on reports appropriately.

•

Positively encouraging and supporting employees and agency workers to report such exploitation which
may be occurring within their communities through the procedures detailed in the posters and worker
leaflets.

•

Requiring labour providers and other organisations in the labour supply chain to adopt policies and
procedures consistent with the above. The Company only uses specified, reputable employment
agencies to source labour and always verifies the practices of any new agency it is using before

adopt policies and procedures consistent with the above, and to provide advice and information on this
issue.

This Policy Statement is made in accordance with s.54(1) of the Modern Slavery Action 2015, and has
been approved by the Board of Directors. This Statement has been signed by the Companies’ Managing
Directors on 3 October 2018.

Slavery & Human Trafficking Statement
This note communicates the commitment of Frontier Economics to abide
by the legislation contained within the Modern Slavery Act (2015).

Organisational Structure
Frontier Economics Ltd (“Frontier”, henceforth) is an economic consultancy
incorporated in the United Kingdom, with offices across Europe in London,
Belgium, France, Germany, Republic of Ireland and Spain.
Frontier is controlled by a Board of Directors and owned by shareholders, all of
whom are employees of the organisation.
Frontier is predominately involved in the provision of economic advice to other
businesses via telephone, email and face to face consultancy formats
(“Services”, henceforth).

Definitions
Frontier considers that modern slavery encompasses:
a. Human trafficking;
b. Forced work, through mental or physical threat;
c. Being owned or controlled by an employer through mental or physical
abuse or the threat of abuse;
d. Being dehumanised, treated as a commodity or being bought or sold as
property;
e. Being physically constrained or to have restriction placed on freedom of
movement.

Commitment
Frontier acknowledges its responsibilities under the Modern Slavery Act 2015
and is committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking within its own
business and in its supply chains. Frontier understands that this requires an
ongoing review of both its internal practices in relation to its labour force and its
supply chains.
Frontier has a zero tolerance policy towards modern slavery. It will refrain from
entering into business, and/or will discontinue any current business, with any

Modern Slavery Act [2015]

other organisation which knowingly supports or is found to involve itself in
slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour.
No labour provided to Frontier in the pursuance of the provision of its Services is
obtained by means of slavery or human trafficking. Frontier strictly adheres to the
minimum standards required in relation to its responsibilities under relevant
employment legislation in Belgium, France, Germany, Republic of Ireland, Spain
and the United Kingdom, and in many cases exceeds those minimums in relation
to its employees.
Frontier offers employment contracts on a guaranteed-hours basis only; no offers
of employment are made on a zero-hours basis.
Part-time and fixed-term employees within Frontier are provided with the same
pro-rata contractual entitlements as full-time and permanent employees. If these
are not offered, Frontier is able to rely on objectively justifiable grounds.
Frontier’s employees are offered a competitive remuneration package and
Frontier prides itself on the additional benefits it is able to offer its employees on
a wide variety of platforms. It conducts annual staff surveys on an anonymous
basis to give employees a voice on their individual employment, their department
and Frontier as appropriate. Commitment to creating career progression in a
supportive environment has been rewarded by high rankings for Frontier in well
regarded “Best Places to Work” awards.

Potential Exposure
Frontier considers its exposure to modern slavery to be limited. Nonetheless, it
has taken steps to ensure that such practices do not take place in its business, or
the business of any organisation that supplies goods and/or services to it.
In the operation of its business, Frontier’s main supply chains are those related to
the provision of services. Frontier considers its main exposure to the risk of
slavery and human trafficking to exist in its supply chains and those of its clients.

Actions
Frontier carries out due diligence processes in relation to ensuring slavery and/or
human trafficking does not take place in its supply chains.
Frontier has not, to its knowledge, conducted any business with another
organisation which has been found to have involved itself with slavery and/or
human trafficking.
Frontier has reviewed its supplier list for the current financial year to ensure it is
up to date. In accordance with section 54(4) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015,
Frontier has contacted (or attempted to contact) all first tier suppliers to set out
our zero tolerance stance on modern slavery and to ensure that slavery and/or
human trafficking is not taking place.

Modern Slavery Act [2015]

Frontier has taken action to monitor reports of modern slavery and ensure that
there have not been any instances where suppliers have been involved in
activities covered by the Modern Slavery Act. Frontier will also continue to crossreference reports of modern slavery with our first tier supply chain and client list
to ensure this is regularly monitored.
Frontier will seek to discontinue business with any first tier supplier or client found
by the enforcement authorities to be involved in modern slavery.
Frontier encourages use of its whistleblowing policy to report any concerns
regarding modern slavery and will investigate any complaints thoroughly.

Training
Upon commencement of employment, all employees attend an HR Induction. All
employees are made aware of Frontier policies relating to standards of behaviour
that it requires from them. Frontier will ensure that 100% of new starters will
complete the induction within two weeks of commencement of employment.
Frontier also provides training on awareness of modern slavery to those within
Frontier who have been identified as having responsibilities in this regard.
Frontier will ensure that annual update training is provided.

Policies
Frontier also has a Corporate Social Responsibility Policy which further supports
its stance on the Modern Slavery Act. In addition, Frontier has committed to the
UN Global Compact. A Whistleblowing policy is also in place which encourages
the reporting of any wrongdoing which is in the public interest.

People Director
All concerns regarding modern slavery should be addressed to the People
Director. The People Director will undertake an annual review of Frontier’s
obligations towards eradicating modern slavery within its organisation and supply
chains.

Review
This statement is made in pursuance of Section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act
2010 and applies to Frontier and all companies associated to Frontier. It is
reviewed each financial year.

This statement is made on behalf of Glen Dimplex UK Ltd. (""GDC"") pursuant to Section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act (the ""Act"") and
constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement.
GDC is a limited company registered in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (company number 1313016)

Introduction from the Chief Executive Officer
As a key manufacturer and provider in the heating industry, we always work to the highest ethical standards and ensure that we comply with
all laws, regulations and rules that are relevant to our business.
Slavery and human trafficking are totally unacceptable and we will not tolerate forced labour of any description within our business or in our
supply chains. We recognise our moral and legal responsibility to help prevent modern slavery and human trafficking and commit to taking
robust and effective steps to ensure no such activities arise in the operation of our business.
Our aim is to achieve the highest ethical standards in this regard and as a minimum, we will comply with all relevant legislation. We all have
a responsibility to be alert to the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in all our daily activities. With that in mind, our employees are
expected to report to us any concerns they may have in this regard and our managers are expected to act upon any concerns raised without
delay.
This statement sets out the action we have taken to identify, understand and address risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our
own business and in our supply chains. It also sets out the steps we have put in place aimed at ensuring that there is no slavery or human
trafficking in our own business or our supply chains.

Responsibility
Responsibility for our anti-slavery initiatives is as follows:
• Overall: Our Head of HR has been appointed as the key contact for issues relating to modern slavery and human trafficking within our UK
operations. Our Group Purchasing Director has been appointed as the key contact for modern slavery and human trafficking issues within
our supply chains.
• Risk assessments: For our supply chains, the Group Purchasing Department is responsible for carrying out the modern slavery and
human trafficking risk analysis.

Relevant Policies
GDC has in place the following policies that set out our approach to the identification and prevention of modern slavery and human
trafficking in our own business and our supply chains.
• Modern Slavery Policy: Our Modern Slavery Policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business
relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place
anywhere in our supply chains.
• Purchasing Code of Conduct: We are committed to ensuring that our suppliers adhere to the highest ethical standards. Suppliers are
required to demonstrate that they provide their workers with safe working conditions, treat them with dignity and respect, and act ethically
and within the law in their use of labour. Serious violations of the organisation's supplier code of conduct will lead to the termination of the
business relationship (as described in the “Code of Business Ethics and Conduct”).
• Code of Business Ethics and Conduct: The Code sets out the standard of ethical conduct we expect from our suppliers. Suppliers are
expected to sign up to the Code and to ensure that they comply with it, with major emphasis on areas which are considered to be at higher
risk. The Code also sets out the implications for a supplier of acting in breach, including termination of the business relationship.

Due Diligence and Compliance
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk, we undertake due diligence when considering taking on new suppliers and regularly
review our existing suppliers against the same criteria. Our due diligence and reviews include:
• Assessing whether or not particular activities, countries or regions are high risk in relation to slavery or human trafficking by conducting
supplier audits or assessments;
• We consider suppliers from Eastern Europe or Asia to be a potential higher risk and the auditing or assessment of suppliers from those
regions will have a greater degree of focus on slavery and human trafficking;
• Taking steps to improve substandard suppliers' practices, including providing advice to suppliers through the audit process and face to face
meetings on their premises;
• Invoking sanctions against suppliers that fail to improve their performance in line with an action plan or seriously violate our supplier code of
conduct, including the termination of the business relationship;
• In addition, the company directors of the supplier are asked to sign up to our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct, particularly in areas
which are considered to be at higher risk.

Measuring Performance
In order to measure how effective we are in ensuring that modern slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our business or supply
chains, we are:
• Continuing to develop a system for supply chain verification, in place since April 2016, whereby the organisation evaluates potential
suppliers before they enter the supply chain; and
• Conducting a review of our existing supply chains, expected to be completed by March 2017, whereby the organisation evaluates existing
suppliers.

Training
We require all key staff within our supply chain to complete training on modern slavery to ensure that they understand the risks of modern
slavery and human trafficking infiltrating our business or supply chains.

MODERN SLAVERY & HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT
Introduction from Tim Fox, Director
Software AG (UK) Ltd is committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in
our supply chains or in any part of our business and to provide a work environment that is free from
human trafficking and slavery.
We will not tolerate or condone human trafficking or slavery in any part of our global organization.
This statement is consistent with Software AG’s Global Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code
of Conduct”) which sets forth fundamental principles of law and ethics governing the way that
Software AG does business. This Code can be found on www.softwareag.com.
Software AG strictly prohibits the use of modern slavery and human trafficking in our operations and
supply chain. Our expectations for responsible, ethical and legal conduct are applicable to all parties
who work on behalf of Software AG worldwide, including, but not limited to, its employees, partners,
contractors, and other representatives that act on behalf of Software AG, and to its vendors and
suppliers.
Software AG is and will continue to be committed to implementing systems and controls aimed at
ensuring that modern slavery is not taking place anywhere within our organization or in any of our
supply chains. We expect that our suppliers will hold their own suppliers to the same high standards.

Organizational Structure and Background
Software AG (UK) Ltd is a provider of digital software for business processes across a range of
sectors, including banking, finance, education, telecom, transportation/logistics, energy and utilities,
government, insurance, manufacturing and retail. We are a part of the Software AG Group,
established in 1969, and our ultimate parent company is Software AG with its head office in
Darmstadt, Germany. We have over 180 employees in the UK. The Group has over 4,500
employees worldwide and operates in more than 70 countries in North & South America, Europe,
Middle East & Africa, and Asia.
Our business is organised into 4 business units: Go to Market (consisting of Sales, Pre-Sales and
Marketing); Research & Development; Professional Services (delivery); and Business Support (back
office).

Our Colleagues
Software AG operates a rigorous recruitment selection process for all hiring decisions which includes
obtaining documented proof of the individual’s right to work in the country in which they will be
employed. We will always pay at least the minimum wage rate applicable in the geography in which
they work.

Software AG aims to ensure that all our people are treated fairly and with compassion and dignity
throughout their employment and our Code of Conduct provides clear guidance on the standards of
behavior expected from all employees across all areas of business.
Software AG has established a Compliance Board to implement and monitor the company’s
compliance programme. It reviews and evaluates compliance issues and concerns within the
organization and enforces that employees are in compliance with the law, that internal policies and
procedures are being followed, and that whistleblowers are protected.

Our Supply Chain and Risks:
Software AG has zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking and requires its supply chain
suppliers to observe all applicable laws and conduct business in an ethical and responsible manner.
Our major suppliers are generally large multinational companies who have their own ethical standards
of behavior in place. Our spend commitments are with third parties in IT, marketing, real estate,
facilities and professional services, and are made using written contracts. We do not pay cash for
services.
We have not identified any instances of modern slavery occurring in our supply chain and therefore it
can be difficult to measure the effectiveness of our policies in reducing the risk of slavery and human
trafficking.
To ensure all those in our supply chain and contractors comply with our values and ethics we have in
place a supply chain compliance programme. This consists of our Supplier Code of Conduct, which
all suppliers are required to adhere to.
Where they have their own code, we have an internal checklist to ensure that it covers the same
criteria as ours, specifically, but not solely, in the areas of: Employee Conduct; Child & Forced Labour;
Discrimination; Employment Rights; Compensation & Working Hours; Protection of Health & Job
Safety; Environmental Protection; Corruption & Bribery; Supplier Relationships.
We also have a Supplier Code of Conduct enforcement guideline. The Compliance Board reserves
the right to periodically review the existence of the signed “Supplier Code of Conducts”, and the
Purchasing Department is required to report any supplier who does not comply with our Supplier
Code of Conduct after several requests to the Compliance Board.

Training
All Software AG employees take mandatory online training on our Code of Conduct, and an
assessment must be completed to ensure understanding and acceptance of the policy. Individual
assessments are tracked and monitored until successful completion.

Our effectiveness in combating slavery and human trafficking
As stated above, we have not identified any instances of modern slavery occurring in our supply chain
and therefore it can be difficult to measure the effectiveness of our policies in reducing the risk of
slavery and human trafficking.

Page 2|3

DocuSign Envelope ID: 0DA7C961-6C03-46F3-8B38-AAFB78ECC9AA

As part of our ongoing risk assessment and due diligence processes, we will consider whether
circumstances warrant us carrying out audits of suppliers for their compliance with our Suppliers Code
of Conduct.
We will continue to assess whether circumstances warrant the inclusion of specific anti-slavery and
human trafficking language in any of our policies governing business conduct.

Signed for and on behalf of Software AG (UK) Limited

STATEMENT
This statement sets out the steps that Pendragon PLC and its subsidiaries (“Pendragon”) have taken to prevent modern slavery and
human trafficking occurring within any part of its businesses or supply chain during the financial year ending 31 December 2017, and is
made pursuant to the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
Our Structure, Business and Supply Chains
Pendragon PLC is the parent company of a group of companies which specialise in the retailing of used and new vehicles, and the
service and repair of vehicles (aftersales), primarily through our 200 franchise points operating under the brands of ‘Stratstone’ for the
premium vehicle segment and ‘Evans Halshaw’ for the volume vehicle segment in the UK, and our online platforms stratstone.com and
evanshalshaw.com. This statement relates to all companies in the group.
Pendragon currently employs around 9,000 team members, the vast majority of whom are based at motor vehicle dealerships in the UK.
Pendragon uses a wide variety of national, local and international suppliers to source goods, services and equipment for the operation
of its businesses. In particular, we work principally with a variety of vehicle manufacturers from whom we obtain our principal products:
motor vehicles and aftersales parts. The directors recognise the nature of our supply chain makes checking for illegal activity challenging,
but there are a number of checks and safeguards we have been able to put in place that reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking
occurring in our supply chain, as explained below.
Our Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy
In November 2015, the Board approved the Pendragon Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy (the “Policy”). The Policy adopted the
following anti-slavery value:-

PENDRAGON PLC ANTI-SLAVERY VALUE
As part of our culture of good governance for good business, at Pendragon PLC we operate to a set of core values which reflect
our relationships with our principal stakeholder groups: customers, manufacturers, shareholders, suppliers and team members.
We adopt a behavioural attitude for all our business relationships, reflecting our attitude to the exploitation of individuals in any
form, and more particularly the offences under the Modern Slavery Act 2015. We are committed to opposing modern slavery in
all its forms and preventing it by whatever means we can. We demand the same attitude of all who work for us and expect it of
all with whom we have business dealings.
OUR ATTITUDE TO MODERN SLAVERY IS: ZERO TOLERANCE.

Our full Policy is available for download at:http://www.pendragonplc.com/investors/corporate-responsibility/
The Policy sets out the steps we have taken to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking occurring in our business or supply chain,
who is responsible for the prevention of modern slavery in our business, the steps team members and suppliers are able to take to report
modern slavery or human trafficking and the safeguards we have in place to ensure reporting can occur in confidence.

Registered in England. Number: 2304195

Our Due Diligence Processes in Relation to Slavery and Human Trafficking
Following the approval and publication of our Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy in November 2015, we have (i) conducted risk
assessments with internal audit to identify which parts of our businesses are most at risk from modern slavery; (ii) engaged with all our
major suppliers to convey our Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy and the Pendragon PLC Anti-Slavery Value, and asked suppliers
to provide confirmation that they have read and understood the Policy and will adhere to it; (iii) conducted a survey of our suppliers to
establish what steps, measures and practices they have implemented to prevent modern slavery occurring in their organisations; (iv)
introduced supplier pre-screening where appropriate into our contract and tender processes; and (v) introduced contractual provisions
where appropriate into our supply contracts to confirm that our suppliers adhere to and accept our Policy and the Modern Slavery Act
2015.
Responses and the reaction of our suppliers to the due diligence steps we have implemented are reviewed allowing refining and modifying
of these to ensure they are appropriate in supporting adherence to, and implementation of our Policy.
Whilst the directors believe that Pendragon companies are generally at low risk of exposure to modern slavery and human trafficking,
our internal risk assessments have identified which of our suppliers and sub-contractors are potentially more exposed than others, and to
which further diligence will be applied.
Measuring the Effectiveness of the Policy
The Pendragon PLC anti-slavery value statement makes it clear that our attitude to modern slavery is zero tolerance. To this extent, we
have not adopted any performance indicators as any instance of modern slavery or human trafficking by a supplier would be considered
to be a breach of the Policy.
However, through our survey of key suppliers, we have recorded (i) how many of our suppliers have read and agreed to adhere to our
Policy; (ii) how many of our suppliers have implemented their own contractual arrangements with prohibitions against the use of forced,
compulsory or trafficked labour or anyone held in slavery or servitude (iii) how many of our suppliers place obligations on their own
employees to familiarise themselves with the supplier’s own anti-slavery and human trafficking policies; (iv) how many of our suppliers
conduct their own modern slavery risk assessments and (v) what steps our suppliers have taken to control and monitor the risk and
contravention of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. Where a supplier has indicated to us that they are not yet in a position to provide positive
affirmation, we have also asked for confirmation as to the likely timescale by which they will be able to comply.
From 2018, we intend to re-survey and reassess our key supplies on a bi-annual basis.
Training and Awareness of our Team Members
All Pendragon team members have an obligation to familiarise themselves with our Policy and procedures to help in the identification and
prevention of modern slavery. Adherence to our Policy forms part of all team members’ obligations under their contract of employment.
The full Policy is available on our internet site. To further raise awareness of the Policy internally, the Policy was published on our internal
intranet portal, together with a short internally produced awareness film designed specifically for the retail motor industry. In addition,
new team members will be introduced to the Policy as part of their induction process.

INTRODUCTION
White Stuff believes that corporate social responsibility is core to our business
practice. We create products that are made with integrity and finished to the
highest standard, always working with good quality and ethical suppliers.
We’re big on the little details and we strive to genuinely connect with those
around us. Creating responsibly is a key foundation to our business, and as such we
endeavour to source, produce and sell all of our products in this way.

OUR COMMITMENT
In 2015, the UK Government passed into law the Modern Slavery Act; we welcome this piece of legislation and
recognise we have a responsibility to uphold our commitment to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking
throughout our organisation and in our supply-chain. People are the most important asset we have and we
must ensure they are treated in a way that fully respects their human rights. We will ensure that our policies and
procedures are updated and that we have processes to enable our suppliers to learn from our values.
We will develop and deliver training, to ensure awareness and understanding of the requirements of the Act
to the relevant people, including our procurement teams and the senior managers within our organisation.
Slavery is a complex issue and exists in many different forms. From adults forced to work against their will,
to child labour and trafficked labour, we need to find effective methods to eradicate these practices from our
supply chains and businesses, and are taking our first steps towards this, collating data by asking our suppliers
specific questions about their own supply chains. Greater transparency will allow us to understand where the
risks are and, in turn, enable us to make informed decisions so we can prioritise how we approach the issue.

OUR BUSINESS
White Stuff employs 1900 people, 1500 in the UK across 140 Shops & Concessions; 300 employees
within our Head Office and distribution centre based in London & Leicester; and 100 employed within
International shops in continental Europe. Our product supply base is manufactured across
16 countries consisting of 90 product suppliers.

MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT
OCTOBER 2016

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
White Stuff clothing and products are currently made in 16 countries across the world. 80% of our products
are manufactured in China, India, Turkey and Portugal across 120 factories. These are the factories that supply
us directly, otherwise known as ‘first tier’. However, the supply chain is more complex than this, with many
materials suppliers and process sub-contractors feeding into this ‘first tier’.
We regularly check our first tier factories by carrying out ethical audits at their premises. To do this we have
specially trained White Stuff auditors who check our global supply base. If issues are found during an audit we
work with our suppliers to help them resolve the matter in a timely manner.
All suppliers and factories are required to demonstrate compliance to our code of conduct. New suppliers
undergo initial screening and ethical audits as part of our supplier on-boarding process. We review our suppliers
performance each season in a process that not only looks at their commercial performance, but also their
ethical compliance. The feedback and results are then shared with our suppliers.
We are members of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) and we follow their base code. We have turned their base
code into our own pictorial White Stuff Code of Conduct. This code is translated into the local language and
posted inside each factory. To check their understanding of the code our auditors will interview workers during
the audit process. It is through these conversations that we believe we get a credible insight into the working
conditions within each factory.
Being a member of the ETI gives us the opportunity to collaborate and work together with not only other
brands, but additionally NGO’s and Trade Unions, where possible.

OUR POLICIES
Our internal policies are designed to educate and empower people to demonstrate our
values. Our own business policies relating to modern slavery are: the Anti Bribery and
Corruption policy; Equal Opportunities policy; Whistle Blowing policy; and Ethical
Sourcing Code of Conduct. Our policies are designed to help our people consistently
live our values and encourage them to report any disconcerting activity. We have a
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) committee that champion this and they continue
to explore where we can introduce new policies and update existing policies.
For example, to include our commitment to educate our people and our supply chain
about the modern slavery act and our responsibility.
Our Ethical Sourcing Code of Conduct includes prohibiting forced labour and child labour,
and, as such, we have revised our auditors’ manual to include extra checks in relation to slavery
and human trafficking. In addition, each auditor has received extra training to ensure they
understand their role in detecting issues.
As many issues can be hidden and difficult to uncover, we always look for ways to improve
practices and increase effectiveness. We will, as necessary, further develop and implement
effective auditing processes and reporting systems, and develop effective remediation
programmes with respect to solving grievances where we find them.

MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT
OCTOBER 2016

DUE DILIGENCE AND RISK ASSESSMENT
As part of our due diligence process, in relation to slavery and trafficking for our non-product suppliers, we are
using a questionnaire to conduct a risk assessment that asks suppliers a series of specific questions to gather
data. We will then conduct a review of all questionnaire responses by rating them high, medium or low risk and
work with each non-product supplier individually to ensure compliance with our values & code of conduct.
Due to the complexities and intricacies of our product supply chain, we are delving deeper and carrying out
an assessment of our supply chain risk. All of our suppliers have been given a detailed introduction to the
Modern Slavery Act and its importance. Focusing on our largest first tier clothing suppliers, we are researching
the extent of their second tier supply chain, which will enable us to map the results. Progress will be measured
using a set of key performance indicators (KPI’s) including: number of suppliers engaged; number of supplier
responses received; number of second tier suppliers mapped; number of suppliers audited; number of auditors
trained; number of product team trained; number of senior managers trained. The information generated will
then be analysed and a report drawn up outlining our findings.

INTRODUCTION
At White Stuff we continue to create products that are made with integrity and finished to
the highest standard. We choose good quality and ethical suppliers to work with and this is
reflected in our goods. Creating responsibly is a key foundation to our business. This means
that we endeavour to source, produce and sell all of our products in this way.

OUR COMMITMENT
We published our first Modern Slavery statement in October 2016. We welcomed the legislation because we recognise
our responsibility towards people working in our own business and in our supply chain. Our Create Responsibly Strategy
continues to be one of the five pillars of our brand vision. We promote the welfare and wellbeing of our communities,
locally and globally, by creating connections and creating products responsibly. Delivering this aim is our dedicated Ethical
Sourcing team who are committed to sourcing products in a way that improves the wellbeing of the people in our supply
chain. This year, we have taken steps to educate key stakeholders about the risks of slavery, in partnership with NGOs and
other brands that are members of Ethical Trading Initiative. Our policies are continually reviewed to make sure that they
are relevant. We have taken steps towards checking the conditions of workers further down the supply chain, using a risk
based approach to assess where our priorities need to be. After mapping the factories in the second and third tiers of our
clothing suppliers, we undertook a pilot audit programme in India in February 2017 for our second tier suppliers. We have
also developed more in depth training for our Turkish suppliers.
This statement has been approved by the board of directors.

OUR BUSINESS
White Stuff employs 2000 people: 1500 in the UK across 160 Shops & Concessions; 350 employees within our Head

product suppliers and 400 non-product suppliers, including recruitment agencies, logistics and shop fitting services.

MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT
OCTOBER 2017

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN

Our suppliers currently manufacture in sixteen countries across the world in 160 factories. 80% of our clothing and products are
made in four main countries: China; India; Turkey and Portugal. The workers who work in these ‘first tier’ factories produce and
package the finished product. Each factory has been ethically audited to check the working conditions by our own specially trained
auditors. By working closely with our suppliers to resolve issues we are proud that we have improved the working conditions for
60,000 workers in these factories over the year.
Clothing supply chains are complex, and ours is no different. Workers in the ‘second tier’ contribute significantly to the manufacture
of our clothing and products. They spin and weave or knit the yarn, then finish, dye and print our fabrics. This year we have made
progress to map the extent of our second and third tier factories by asking our ‘first tier’ suppliers to provide details of their supply
chains. They were happy to help and we now have a significant amount of information about these factories. As well as mapping our
second tier, we ask suppliers in the first tier to ensure our Code of Conduct is signed up to by factories in their supply chain, as part
of our work as members of the Ethical Trading Initiative.

OUR POLICIES
Our internal policies are designed to educate and enable people to put our values into practice. Our own business policies relating to
modern slavery provide a framework and process to support and protect our colleagues, suppliers and customers. These include:
THE ANTI BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION POLICY
THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES POLICY
THE WHISTLE BLOWING POLICY
THE ETHICAL SOURCING CODE OF CONDUCT
Our policies are designed to help our people consistently live our values and encourage them to report any issues of concern. We
have a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) committee who champion this. The committee make sure that our existing policies
remain both relevant and useful, for example to include our commitment to educate our people and our supply chain about the
modern slavery act and our responsibilities.
Our ethical sourcing policies have had a positive impact on the workers in our supply chain. We resolved over 1200 issues, from
labour and wage problems to health and safety, found during ethical audits within our first tier factories throughout the year. The
effectiveness of our policies means that we resolve issues in a shorter amount of time; issues are now resolved in an average of 10
weeks rather than 18 weeks that it took last year. Resolving our issues quicker meant that we had the time to carry out a second tier
pilot programme.
We continue to work closely with our team of in-country auditors to develop new ways of detecting issues, such as modern slavery.
We have adopted a new auditing approach in Turkey where we do unannounced audits because of the high numbers of refugees
in the country, many seeking work in the textile supply chain. As a responsible company, we want to ensure all workers are being
treated fairly and not being discriminated against or employed against their will, in line with our Code of Conduct.
We are committed to train our own people and we completed this in a number of different ways. We trained 450 White Stuff
employees about the Modern Slavery Act and the possibility that modern slavery may be present in our business and supply chains.
We explained how we are and will be checking working conditions to ensure there are processes to detect and remedy modern
slavery. Communication is now a regular feature of our ‘Family Gathering’ meetings at our HQ in London and our DC in Leicester, in
addition to our Brand Vision inductions for new starters and as part of our product team meetings. We share information for all our
teams on our internal intranet, The Tea Room. We have also improved access to information on our activities on our website, making
it easier for our customers to navigate:

MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT
OCTOBER 2017

DUE DILIGENCE AND RISK ASSESSMENT
We have engaged with each of our first tier suppliers to educate them on the Modern Slavery legislation. We are aware that there
are many workers who contribute to the manufacture of our clothing and products further down the supply chain and this is why we
have started to take a look at the conditions in some of the lower tier factories.
We carried out a risk assessment across our first tier supplier base to help us choose which second tier factories to focus on. Our
clothing suppliers make up our largest proportion of product purchase at over 90%. We asked them to disclose the names and
addresses of their suppliers who contribute to the manufacturing of our clothing so we could map and asses the highest risk. With a
75% response rate, we were able to look at the information supplied and compare that with political, social and human rights risks.
As a result, we concluded that we should conduct a pilot programme in India and further training for our suppliers based in Turkey.
During the pilot programme, we were granted access to visit and audit five second tier factories who supply our first tier clothing
suppliers in India, accompanied by their ethical compliance managers so we could tackle the issues together. There were many
learnings from this pilot programme that we will build upon going forward.
Here are three key outcomes:
1. In general fabric mills, printers and dyers are much larger factories and geographically
further far apart from those which cut and sew, making the workers more difficult to access.
2. It is important that our auditor in India has an understanding of the different processes
in these factories. She now has an understanding of the possible non-compliances to look out for.
3. There are many chemical processes in the manufacture of textiles and we were able to
share practical advice directly with the workers on the importance of safely handling chemicals.
In January 2017 we held a workshop for our Turkish suppliers at our London Head Office. We discussed the situation and risks
associated with the growing migrant population in their country. We invited Anti-Slavery International to present an interactive
session where the risks were highlighted and ways to mitigate were discussed. At the workshop, we announced a change to our audit
programme from announced to unannounced audits. Each supplier showed support for this and felt confident that their respective
factories had in place effective policies and procedures. We successfully carried out these audits and timed them in line with
production peaks. Our auditors were able to validate that these first tier factories are those that manufacture our clothing. Satisfied
with the results of these audits, we will be sharing the results of our second tier pilot programme with them and encouraging them
to check conditions of workers at their direct suppliers with the assistance of our audit team.
During the year, we have contacted our non-product suppliers to raise awareness and ask specific questions relating to their
compliance with the Modern Slavery Act. We have received over 50% responses and half of those that replied are required to
comply with the Act, having a turnover in excess of £36 million. We are in the process of collating their statements and sending out
reminders to the non-responders. Where a non-product supplier has a lower turnover, we are asking them to sign up to our Code of
Conduct.

OUR COMMITMENT
At White Stuff we continue to create products that are made with
integrity and finished to the highest standard. We choose good quality
and ethical suppliers to work with and this is reflected in our products.
We published our first two Modern Slavery statements in October 2016 and 2017.
We welcomed the legislation because we recognise our responsibility towards people working in our
own business and in our supply chain. Creating responsibly is a key foundation to our business.
This means that we endeavour to source, produce and sell all our products in this way.

Our Create Responsibly Strategy continues to be one of the five pillars of our brand vision.
Our Code of Conduct is at the core of our strategy and it was developed using the Ethical
Trading Initiative Base Code as a foundation.
Our Code specifically stipulates not only that suppliers and their subsidiaries comply with laws of their respective countries, but
that forced labour must not be used. We promote the welfare and wellbeing of our communities, locally and globally, by creating
connections and creating products responsibly. We have a dedicated Ethical Sourcing team who are committed to sourcing
products in a way that improves the wellbeing of the people in our supply chain.
As well as developing policies and procedures to resolve incidents of modern slavery in our supply chain where we find them, we
are committed to tackling the root causes of modern slavery. We acknowledge that the way that we ourselves work can have an
impact on workers in our supply chain. We must therefore remain vigilant and take steps to ensure we adopt best practices and keep
communication with our suppliers open and transparent.The Act has helped us to start conversations with our suppliers where we
can talk about how exactly our actions can affect workers.To do so effectively, we decided to ask our suppliers to anonymously rate us.
In December 2017, we joined Better Buying, an independent not-for-profit initiative, to help us assess our own practices and identify
areas of improvement.
In January 2018, we revisited the second-tier factories that we audited in our India pilot programme in 2017 and have seen
real improvements in working conditions for workers further down the supply chain. Our Ethical Sourcing team have had
in-depth training on worker voice and representation, deepening their understanding of how developing effective channels of
communication for workers helps engage management and can help to minimise the risk of modern slavery. This training has
been reflected in the success of our Good Workplaces programme in China through collaboration with the
Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) and International Labour Organisation (ILO).

OUR BUSINESS
Established in 1985 and privately owned by our
original founders, White Stuff Group Limited is
a UK-based multichannel fashion and lifestyle
brand recognised as a leader in sociable
retailing. White Stuff Group Limited includes
the main UK trading company, White Stuff
Limited, and White Stuff (Germany) GmbH,
the German trading company.
We have 122 UK shops and 30 UK concessions, 12
international concessions and eight stand-alone shops in
Germany; five concessions in Belgium; 355 UK and Ireland

wholesale accounts and 411 international wholesale accounts,
in addition to our website whitestuff.com.
White Stuff employs 1938 people: 1474 in the UK across
154 Shops & Concessions; 344 employees within our Head
Offices based in London & Leicester; and 120 employed
within International shops in Germany and Belgium. We have
100 direct product suppliers and 400 active non-product
suppliers, including recruitment agencies, logistics and shop
fitting services. Our Ethical Sourcing team is based at our
UK HQ in London and they work closely with our product
teams and our direct suppliers, enabling them to carry out
their work effectively.

OUR PRODUCT SUPPLY CHAIN
We source our branded products from firsttier suppliers across 16 countries. We have 12
long term strategic suppliers and relationships
spanning over 15 years with many. This has
enabled us to build a good level of trust and
transparency of working conditions having
carried out 135 ethical audits over the year.
Over 80% of our production is manufactured in four
countries: India, China, Cambodia and Bangladesh. Our
suppliers are chosen because of their skills and good ethical
credentials, each having signed up to our Code of Conduct.
We physically audit our clothing, accessories and footwear
factories on an annual basis. We then follow up to ensure
that issues are being resolved.
We have our own trained auditors, which ensures the
audit information we collect is immediate and accurate. We
ensure we have personally trained each auditor in our own
audit methodology in line with our Code of Conduct. These
auditors also audit for us across the globe and we are in
regular contact with them. By employing auditors, we have a
strong relationship with them so that we can fully understand
the issues found and how best they can be resolved.

Our auditors also inform us of any social and political
changes that may affect our workers so we can inform our
buying teams. We store our supply chain information on an
online platform. The platform has recently been upgraded to
effectively capture our secondary tier mapping and the data
from second-tier audits.
After a successful pilot last year, we have extended our audit
programme in India to include our second-tier suppliers.
This means that weavers, printers and dyers will be audited
to White Stuff standards. We are training our first-tier
suppliers’ compliance teams to conduct the audits for us
because we want to approach this next step in partnership.
By mapping our secondary tiers, we find that we have an
additional six countries in our supply chain bringing the
total to 22 countries. We carefully budget each year for our
ethical activities to remain effective and to show year on year
improvement. As part of our membership requirements, we
report annually to the Ethical Trading Initiative, who assess
our work against a set of criteria.

OUR OWN BUSINESS POLICIES
Our internal policies are designed to educate
and enable people to put our values into
practice. Our own business policies relating
to modern slavery are:

Our policies explicitly state that offences under the ‘modern
slavery’ term are against the White Stuff ways of working as
well as setting out a clear procedure for our workers
to follow if they see any suspicious activity.

• the Anti Bribery and Corruption policy
• the Equal Opportunities policy
• the Whistle Blowing policy
• the Ethical Sourcing Code of Conduct

Our policies are continually reviewed to make sure that
they are relevant. We have a Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR) committee who provide oversight on all ethical
activity. The committee make sure that our existing
policies remain relevant.

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN POLICIES
Our ethical sourcing policies have had
a positive impact on workers improving
conditions for over 60,000 workers.
This year we resolved 300 labour, wage,
health and safety issues in our first-tier
supply base, found during our ethical audits.
The effectiveness of our policies means that we have a
greater level of compliance within these factories with
96% maintaining a satisfactory ethical status year on year. In
our secondary tier pilot, we collaborated successfully with
our first-tier suppliers’ compliance teams to implement
35 corrective actions, some of which were critical. These
included health and safety issues around chemical handling,
hygiene and sanitation. The pilot led us to improve working
conditions for 1,200 workers of which we previously had
no visibility.
We continue to work closely with our team of in-country
auditors to develop new ways of detecting issues, such as
modern slavery. We continue to support our suppliers in
Turkey where we do unannounced audits because of the
high number of refugees in the country with many seeking
work in the textile supply chain.
As a responsible company, we want to ensure all workers
are being treated fairly and not being discriminated against or
employed against their will, in line with our Code of Conduct.
We have briefed our suppliers on the importance of
addressing modern slavery through face to face and Skype
meetings. We have also distributed presentations for them
to share in turn with their own suppliers.

We have an ongoing commitment to train our own people.
This year, the Ethical Sourcing team have attended external
training with the ETI on Human Rights, Due Diligence and
ETI Base Code clause, Freedom of Association. In turn, they
have trained a further 228 of our White Stuff employees
about the Modern Slavery Act and the possibility of it being
present in our business and supply chains. The training also
includes what we are, and will be doing, to check and resolve
any poor working conditions.
Communication is a regular feature of our ‘Family Gathering’
meetings at our HQ in London and our DC in Leicester.
These meetings are in addition to our Brand Vision inductions
for new starters and as part of our product team meetings.
We share information for our teams on our internal intranet,
The Tea Room. We also have accessible information about
out activities on our website.
As part of our involvement in Better Buying, we have enabled
a safe place for our suppliers to rate us on our performance.
We are looking forward to creating conversations with them
and demonstrating our willingness to show improvement.
Internally our Ethical Sourcing team has delivered a
presentation and feedback session to 80 people who work
in our product teams. Purchasing practices are an important
part of our relationship with our suppliers and decisions we
make can have a direct effect on the workers in our supply
chain. We are collating feedback from our suppliers as well as
our own staff and will be developing training.

DUE DILIGENCE, RISK ASSESSMENT
& STEPS TAKEN
In our previous statements we have explained
how we have carried out risk assessments
across our supply chain to help us focus
on areas of the world with the most salient
human rights issues. This year we have
applied learnings from the Human Rights Due
Diligence training which has re-enforced that
we have been focusing in the right areas, our
clothing suppliers in China, India and Turkey.
CHINA:
We have seen real success with our Good Workplaces
programme, in collaboration with the ETI and ILO’s
SCORE programme. We have seen an increase in worker
satisfaction and the development of an effective committee
where workers can raise issues with management, being
rewarded for their contributions. This minimises the
likelihood of modern slavery by providing a channel for
remedy and potential whistleblowing as well as increasing the
management’s capacity to support worker issues. Please see
here for further details of the programme.
We have also championed a pilot and are ready to offer
training to more of our suppliers in the Guangdong Province
on the Collective Consultation Regulation. This allows
workers to organise themselves and enables them to have
equal and open discussions with the factory management.
We carefully structured our methodology and training

materials to ensure a level of comprehension appropriate
for the workers that we directly trained. This pilot in the
Guangdong Province showed us that workers are keen to
learn about their rights.
INDIA:
By providing training with first-tier suppliers and involving
them in the audit process of their own suppliers (our
secondary tiers), we have seen significant and credible
improvement in working conditions for workers. We have
also applied learnings from the Freedom of Association
training and are starting to engage worker representatives in
the opening and closing meetings of our ethical audits. The
success of this pilot will see us move forward with further,
more detailed training over the next year.
TURKEY:
We engaged all our Turkish suppliers in 2017 to give them
training on modern slavery and the real risks in factories
where refugees will have found work. We followed up with
Skype meetings this year where we discussed how we could
help them check the conditions in their suppliers’ factories.
We have discussed a collaborative engagement with our
suppliers where we apply the approach and lessons learnt
from the successful India pilot. This could mean that we
provide training to our direct suppliers’ compliance teams to
examine conditions further down the supply chain. We will
be further sharing the learnings from the pilot in India to see
how we can move forward.

OUR FUTURE FOCUS:
We set ourselves a set of KPIs in our 2016 statement and recently reviewed them to see if they
were fit for purpose. Going forward, we plan to report on:

•

the number of secondary tier suppliers that we have 			
successfully mapped

•

the number of workers who, because of our 			
recommendations have improved conditions

•

the number countries where we have visibility
of manufacturing in our supply chain

incidents of modern slavery detected

•
•

the number of audits conducted at our secondary tier suppliers

•
•

the number of suppliers’ compliance team trained in 			
White Stuff audit methodology

changes in, and improved practices, based on our
Better Buying results

on Due Diligence, Human Rights
and Freedom of Association. This
ensures we focus on areas of our
supply chain with the highest risk.

We successfully concluded our
secondary tier pilot in India and
validated significant improvements
in working conditions for workers
further down the supply chain.

We are listening to our suppliers
and the workers in our supply chain.
By engaging with Better Buying
we will be able to review our own
practices to ensure we ourselves
are continually improving.

Anti-slavery and Anti-trafficking Statement and Policy
Anti-slavery and anti-trafficking statement and policy
19 November 2020
In accordance with Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, the University is required
to prepare an anti-slavery and anti-trafficking statement for each financial year, setting out
what steps it has taken to ensure that modern slavery is not taking place in its business or
supply chains. The University’s statement for the financial year ended 31 July 2020 is
published below, together with its policy on the issue.

Anti-slavery and anti-trafficking statement for the financial year
ending 31 July 2020
(pursuant to Section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015)
Legal status and activities
The University of Cambridge is a common law corporation and is an exempt charity under
the Charities Act 2011. The incorporation of the University was confirmed by the Oxford
and Cambridge Act 1571, which confirmed its corporate title of ‘The Chancellor, Masters,
and Scholars of the University of Cambridge’. The University operates in the higher
education sector and consists of academic Schools, Faculties and Departments, libraries
and other collections, administrative departments and, for the purposes of this statement,
includes its wholly owned companies as listed in the University’s Financial Statements. Its
mission is to contribute to society through the pursuit of education, learning, and research
at the highest international levels of excellence.
Cambridge Assessment (which provides examination services) and Cambridge University
Press (which provides publishing services) are departments of the University rather than
separate legal entities. Cambridge Assessment is covered by this statement. Cambridge
University Press, however, has broader supply chains and consequently has produced its
own anti-slavery and anti-trafficking statement.
Policy
The University has implemented an Anti-slavery and anti-trafficking policy (published
below) reflecting its commitment to combatting slavery and human trafficking and to
acting with integrity in all its dealings, relationships, and supply chains. The policy outlines

how the University’s various procurement and HR practices, policies and procedures ensure
compliance with its policy commitment.
Activity in the year ending 31 July 2020
Throughout 2019–20, the University has continued to embed and enhance the various
controls and activities outlined in its policy, notably through the ongoing roll-out of its
online training module on this topic, and the continued refinement and operation of
supplier due diligence and approval procedures.
The University did not receive any reports of instances of modern slavery or human
trafficking in the financial year ending 31 July 2020.
The University will continue to raise awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking
and of the need for proper due diligence and risk assessment processes to be applied by
staff and suppliers, in accordance with its policy.
This annual statement was approved by the Council on 19 November 2020.

Anti-slavery and anti-trafficking policy
Modern slavery encompasses slavery, forced and compulsory labour, and human trafficking
whereby individuals are deprived of their freedom and are exploited for commercial or
personal gain as defined in the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The University is committed to
combatting slavery and human trafficking and to acting with integrity in all its dealings,
relationships, and supply chains. It expects the same high standards from all its staff,
suppliers, contractors, and those with whom it does business. This policy applies to all
employees, workers, consultants, and other persons doing business with the University
including all its wholly owned companies, contractors, and suppliers. It applies to
Cambridge Assessment though not to Cambridge University Press, which has developed its
own policy.
The University acknowledges the risk that a supply chain may involve the use of a hidden
or unknown subcontractor reliant on forced labour. Although the University as a higher
education institution considers the risk of modern slavery to be low due to the nature of its
supply chains, it takes its responsibilities to combat modern slavery seriously as
demonstrated by its promotion and adoption of the following policy measures:
The prevention, detection, and reporting of modern slavery in any part of its business or
supply chains is the responsibility of all those working for the University or under its
control.
Appropriate due diligence processes must be carried out in relation to modern slavery
which may include considering human rights in a sector or country, the type of sector in
which a service provider operates, the countries from which services are provided, the
nature of relationships with suppliers, and the complexity of supply chain(s).
All supply chain lines need to be continually risk assessed and managed in relation to
modern slavery and any high-risk suppliers audited. The University’s standard
procurement and contract procedures and documentation address anti-slavery and anti-

trafficking. The trade supplier portal asks questions of potential new suppliers on their
compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 as part of due diligence processes. Under
the supplier approval process the University’s Finance Division reviews all new suppliers,
any changes to existing suppliers and re-activation requests taking this into account.
The University has developed an online training module on anti-slavery and antitrafficking and completion is required or encouraged for a range of relevant new and
existing employees, including all Finance Division staff and those in financial or
purchasing roles across the wider University.
The University highlights modern slavery issues within its ongoing communications
programmes with the University’s Departments, Faculties and other Institutions and with
current trade suppliers to maintain and increase awareness of the issue.
The University encourages anyone to raise any concerns about modern slavery, using its
whistleblowing policy if necessary, and will support anyone who acts in good faith.
The University’s recruitment, Dignity @ Work, equalities, and remuneration and reward
policies and procedures support its efforts to combat modern slavery and human
trafficking.
Cambridge Assessment has equivalent provisions in its separate procurement,
whistleblowing and HR policies and procedures.
The University will continue to develop its commitment to combat modern slavery and
human trafficking and will outline such activities within its annual anti-slavery and antitrafficking statement.
Any breaches of this policy may result in the University taking disciplinary action against
individual(s) and/or terminating its relationship with any organization or supplier.
This policy is managed by the Governance and Compliance Division and was last approved
by the Council on 19 November 2020.

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) went into
effect in the State of California. This law was designed to increase the amount of information made
available by manufacturers regarding their efforts (if any) to address the issue of slavery and human
trafficking, thereby allowing consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products
they buy and the companies they choose to support.
Jerry Leigh has offices in Shanghai, China and in Guatemala City (in addition to U.S. offices), enabling
Jerry Leigh to regularly visit and audit contractors in those countries, which represent the vast majority
of our production.
In order to combat slavery and human trafficking, forced and child labor, Jerry Leigh is committed to
the following policies:
1. Verification – Jerry Leigh performs assessments of potential supplier factories according to a riskbased approach. This approach includes preliminary risk assessments through contractor
questionnaires in addition to factory compliance assessments performed by Jerry Leigh personnel.
This includes required submission of recent third party audit reports. Additionally, Jerry Leigh has
developed, and issues, a Jerry Leigh Manufacturer Code of Conduct to all contractors.
Contractors are evaluated in relation to their compliance with the Manufacturer Code of Conduct
though periodic third party audits.
2. Audits – Jerry Leigh is a proud licensee of the Walt Disney Company, Hasbro, Marvel, Williamson
Dickie, and other licensed brands. We supply product to Walmart, Sears Holdings, Kohl’s, and
many other retailers. As such, Jerry Leigh is required to, and agrees to perform regular social
compliance audits of all facilities. With few exceptions, the audits are unannounced; and, all are
performed by third-party audit firms.
3. Certification – Jerry Leigh’s purchasing agreements require all suppliers to comply with all
applicable laws within the country of business, with international standards, with trade regulations,
and with the Manufacturer Code of Conduct regarding slavery and human trafficking.
4. Accountability – Jerry Leigh employs the use of corrective action plans which outline how a
supplier will resolve issues uncovered in audits. Jerry Leigh has a zero-tolerance policy for the
presence of slavery and human trafficking. If any zero-tolerance items are uncovered in audits, we
require suppliers to rectify the problem immediately, and provide documentation and proof of
remediation. The facility is then reaudited to confirm resolution of the issue. If the contractor fails to
correct a zero tolerance violation in a timely manner, including slavery and human trafficking, Jerry
Leigh may terminate the business relationship.
5. Direct accountability and training of procurement professionals – Jerry Leigh maintains and
enforces internal accountability procedures for employees regarding company standards in slavery
and human trafficking. Jerry Leigh conducts regular internal training for all procurement and
sourcing personnel and management to ensure that they are knowledgeable and aware of the
issues and concerns surrounding the supply chain, including human trafficking and slavery, with a
particular focus on mitigating risks. Training is also conducted by some of our retailers and

contractors are strongly encouraged to participate, wherever possible. All facilities are audited by
3rd party auditors, irrespective of whether or not they participate in training.

Introduction
Staffline recognises that Modern Slavery and Human
Trafficking could be potential risks to our business,
and we are proud of our experience that has grown
through the journey since we first
started our campaign to join with other like-minded
businesses to help victims of modern slavery and
trafficking in the UK.
•

There are an estimated 10-13,000 victims of
Modern-Day Slavery within the UK costing the UK
economy about £4.3bn per year.

•

For each and every Modern Slavery crime
discovered in the UK the estimated cost is over
£330,000 including support for lost earnings and
enforcement

Staffline is the UK’s leading provider of flexible bluecollar workers, supplying over 60,000 staff per day to
c1,700 private sector clients, across a wide range of
industries including agriculture, drinks, driving, food
processing, logistics and
manufacturing. It operates from over 400 locations in UK,
Eire and Poland.
Its world leading Customer Experience platform provides
optimised customer-based staffing management solutions
whilst providing market- leading levels of job satisfaction
for workers.

Staffline are committed to working with all organisations
that take the issue as seriously as we do and who share
our goal to reduce and eliminate this threat in the UK.
Integrity is one of our core values. We have strict policies
and procedures
in place to ensure the consistent monitoring of our
workforce for the signs of human trafficking and
labour exploitation. These checks are not only
paramount to allowing us to investigate and identify
exploitation at the earliest possible stage but are
embedded into our policies and daily
procedures throughout our business, both through our
front-line staff and centrally from the back office.
We are confident that we have the right checks in
place to minimise the risk of modern slavery, human
trafficking and labour exploitation taking
place within our supply chain. However, should our
business be infiltrated, we are able to react quickly and
efficiently to resolve cases. This response is due to the
knowledge and experience held within the Staffline
Compliance team, the awareness levels of the wider
team members, and the relationships we hold with the
relevant government authorities.

Due Diligence, Processes and Action
Taken
Throughout our working relationship with every worker,
our commitment is to ensure the safety, health and
wellbeing of that individual. We have processes and
policies in place to ensure all our trained staff conduct
the correct and regular checks, required by the business,
to enable us to spot any issues at a very early stage. We
invest heavily in Compliance via a dedicated team of
highly experienced individuals trained in assessing risk
and capable of dealing with any problems confidently,
competently and timeously.

All information is uploaded onto our central IT
platform allowing us to have full visibility and run
checks through our system remotely to spot anything
that may look suspicious with shared details, such as
the same bank accounts or multiple occupancy
housing alerts. In the event of any of our staff
spotting anything suspicious our Red Flag Policy
details how this must then
be escalated and dealt with, and our Compliance Team
are always on hand to offer any help and advice
required.
Worker education begins at the induction stage, giving
an insight into Modern Slavery. It explains why it is
illegal in the UK and what the worker should do if they
suspect it is happening to a colleague or they are a
victim themselves.
We are a business partner with the Stronger Together
initiative and show the Stronger Together ‘Daniel and
Weronika’ video to all workers, and literature is available
to all which includes contact details for the relevant
authorities who can assist.

From the moment a potential worker chooses to join
Staffline the checks begin. Checks continue all
throughout the worker’s time with us. This ensures that
the worker has control of their own documentation and
that their job expectations are managed effectively. All
interviews are completed face-to-face with the
individual to make sure that they have freely chosen to
attend. In addition, throughout the registration and
interview process, all application forms are checked
and verified as
being the applicant’s own information. We also ask
where they found out about Staffline and the role.

During their employment, regular checks are conducted
on workers’ welfare in the form of surveys, worker
interviews and our Compliance Team also undertake
regular site audits. Every day, we conduct background
checks on all workers’ details through our central IT
system from our Nottingham Head Office.
Where we use additional avenues of recruitment, such
as other recruitment agencies supplying labour into
Staffline, whether based in the UK or overseas, we
ensure that these are licensed by the Gangmasters
Labour and Abuse Authority and remain compliant
against the GLAA’s standards. We will also conduct our
own regular internal audits on these “second tier”
suppliers in order to ensure they meet our strict
standards.
We also in addition, expect all labour suppliers in our
supply chain to have the necessary checks to help spot
indicators of Modern Slavery throughout their business
and ask all to sign a statement to commit to doing so
before we undertake to use their services.

Effectiveness & Commitment
At Staffline we are fully aware and accept that with
Modern Slavery it can happen anywhere, at any time,
and in any part of our business.
The steps we have taken and continue to take will we
hope, one day eradicate this in time, but we continue,
as in previous years to be vigilant, keep all of our staff
fully up to date with any new
developments, and constantly strive to monitor the
effectiveness of our processes and policies.
We are totally committed to Compliance and Ethical
Standards and strive to operate best practices at all
times. Everyone in the Company is introduced to and
trained to comply with our company compliance
standards and operating procedures at the start of
their employment.
Everyone is given the tools to identify the indicators of
human trafficking and forced labour, and the reporting
channels are very clear for any points of concern. As
soon as an exploitation issue arises, it is urgently flagged
to the appropriate authorities to investigate with the full
co-operation of Staffline supporting throughout the case.
Over the years we have built up an excellent relationship
with Enforcement and Regulatory bodies and regularly
seek advice and guidance on any matters of concern. We
are active members of the GLAA Labour Provider Labour
User forum, and this type of work enables us to share
god practice with other businesses.
As a direct result of a collaboration between other
industry members and the GLAA, Staffline helped
write, produce and fund a short film on Modern Day
Slavery within the UK to assist other
businesses with identification and prevention. This year
we have also invested in a further supply chain risk
strategy to ensure that any potential areas are quickly
identified, and processes amended accordingly.
We are actively part of anti-slavery networks to work
with others to ensure that victims are spotted, looked
after and when they are ready to go back into
employment, we can help with their future placements
for employment, helping them get their life back on
track.

As we have eluded to previously, if an issue is found we
are confident it can be correctly identified
and that our staff are sufficiently trained to know what
to do and when, without placing any of our workers at
any further risk. We will continue to work effectively and
efficiently with our partners, especially those within
enforcement, to ensure that any identified victim is
given the full support of the business in support of their
recovery.
Modern Slavery and Trafficking is an international
problem, and with the links to many criminal
organisations it remains a high risk to any supply chain or
businesses.
Staffline will continue its investment in the identification
& prevention of Modern Slavery, it remains a high priority
for the business and that of our valued clients.

difference to communities, businesses and economies. All Impellam brands share a culture of making and keeping promises – to our clients, our
candidates and each other – engendering trust and lasting relationships.

Our mission is to provide fulfilment and a sense of purpose for our people and help our customers build better businesses in a changing world
This mission, together with our shared signature practices, gives clear guidance on the behaviours and actions we expect from all the people and
organisations that work with Impellam. We choose to engage and partner with like-minded organisations because they recognise people should
be treated with dignity and respect.
Impellam do not believe there is any place in today’s world for slavery or human trafficking. We are committed to continually improving our
practices to combat slavery and human trafficking and to encourage the same high standards from our supply chain and other business partners.
Impellam is a global provider of staffing and recruitment services to a wide range of clients covering a broad range of industry sectors. We have
over 3,000 employees globally across more than 112 locations across the UK, North America, Asia Pacific and mainland Europe. The Group had

Impellam purchases a wide range of products and services from its supply chain, including IT hardware, software and telecommunications;
vehicles; office furniture, equipment and supplies; utilities; travel services; and training services.
Impellam’s Supplier Code of Conduct reflects our responsibility to act ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships, including our
commitment to combating human trafficking and slavery. We believe our highest areas of potential risk are within our supply chain, and in the
provision of agency labour.
In order to mitigate and manage our risk the following activities have been undertaken in 2019:Our Modern Slavery policy has been reviewed to ensure it is still fit for purpose.
Our Modern Slavery policy has been issued to all new employees, who have acknowledged and confirmed they have read and understood
the same.
All new employees have completed Modern Slavery training within one month of joining the Company.
All existing employees have completed refresher Modern Slavery training annually, part of which includes the Modern Slavery policy.
All employees have been advised on how they can report any concerns they may have associated with Modern Slavery.
All employees have been reminded of our confidential whistleblowing helpline if they wish to make an anonymous report and posters are
displayed in our offices.
All suppliers agree to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct as part of their contractual relationship with Impellam and its businesses.
When tendering suppliers are required to provide information on how they comply with the regulatory responsibilities including the Modern
Slavery Act.
Our significant suppliers are required to complete an ethical questionnaire. We take a risk-based approach towards our suppliers due to the
number we engage and undertake audits on those suppliers where we consider the exposure to be greatest. No significant problems have

number we engage and undertake audits on those suppliers where we consider the exposure to be greatest. No significant problems have
been indicated within our supply chain.
All our branches received at least one compliance audit during which pre-employment checks, including eligibility to work, references,
qualifications and proof of national insurance numbers, were reviewed.
We have performed random checks within our UK businesses to identify where agency workers may be sharing bank accounts, addresses
or telephone numbers as this can be an indication of illegal or unethical behaviour. Where these are shared, we approach the individuals
involved to ensure this is voluntary, for example where couples share a bank account.
We have not used or accepted forced, bonded or involuntary prison labour or child labour; nor will we hold onto our workers’ identity papers
or knowingly work with businesses that do.
No breaches of the Modern Slavery Act were reported during 2019.
We review our policies and procedures regularly, not only to ensure they remain relevant, but also to assess our progress.
This statement applies to Impellam Group plc and all its subsidiaries.

Modern Slavery Statement

Travis Perkins Plc
Modern Slavery Transparency Statement 2019
This statement has been produced in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act
2015, section 54. It constitutes our Modern Slavery Transparency Statement for
Travis Perkins plc and its relevant group subsidiaries1 for the nancial year
ending 31st December 2019. Travis Perkins plc and its subsidiary companies
are referred to as the Travis Perkins Group throughout this statement.

Introduction
The Travis Perkins Group is opposed to all forms of unethical business behaviour. We recognise the harmful impact that modern slavery has on
individuals and society and we are committed to help prevent these illegal practices.
We base our approach to business on our ve cornerstones; keeping people safe, upholding family values, working for our customers, being the
best and making decent returns. We communicate these both to our colleagues and suppliers as we believe it is what makes us different from
our competitors. The cornerstones come down to doing the “right thing” which is how we have approached the issue of modern slavery
internally with colleagues and with our suppliers.

Our businesses and our supply chains
Travis Perkins Group is the largest distributor of building materials to both consumers and the trade in the UK. We have over 20 business units
operating within the UK, with complex supply chains sourcing products from around the world. Our businesses include well-known brands such
as Travis Perkins, Benchmarx, BSS, Keyline, City Plumbing, PTS, Wickes, Toolstation and Tile Giant. For further detail on the business structure
and the business model, please see p.4 and p.12 of the Annual Report & Accounts 2019.
We deliver products direct to customers via our own distribution channels and direct from our suppliers, and to customers via our network of
approximately 1,800 stores and trade branches. Our product categories range from construction products for building, repair, maintenance or
improvement to industrial civil engineering products, plumbing and heating systems, kitchens, bathrooms and DIY products.

Policies and control on Modern Slavery
The Travis Perkins Group is committed to being a responsible business. We continually strive to work with suppliers who share the same values.
Since 2008 we have published and updated clear supplier expectations and worked with our suppliers to uphold them. Our ‘Supplier
Commitments’ detail our requirements around environmental and social behaviours in our supply chain. Speci c guidance is provided on
modern slavery.
The Supplier Commitments have been communicated to our suppliers and incorporated into our supplier manual and responsible sourcing
procedures. The supplier due diligence process, described on the following page, includes an assessment against the requirements of the
Supplier Commitments.
Regarding our own employees, we uphold high standards and comply fully with the relevant employment laws and Right to Work checks for the
countries within which we operate. We have recruitment policies and clear standards of conduct which are included in our employee handbook.
Our employees have access to a whistleblowing line and are encouraged to report any concerns. No reports were registered via the
whistleblowing line in 2019 relating to modern slavery.

Due diligence and supplier performance

Our centrally-controlled suppliers go through a due diligence process, which includes two stages. Firstly, a contractual commitment to our
ethical requirements through reference to our Supplier Commitments in the standard trading agreement. Secondly, an assessment of
compliance with the commitments through an Online Risk Assessment (ORA) questionnaire2. The ORA includes but is not limited to Business
Ethics, Labour and Human Rights, Environment, Health & Safety and Product Quality. On completion of the ORA, the supplier receives a summary
for their company, including Environmental Responsibility, Social Responsibility, and Quality & Product. Based on the results, our experienced QA
team contacts them to request further documentary evidence or undertake additional tasks to demonstrate compliance or mitigate risk. There
are cases where a supplier account has been closed based on their ORA results although this has not been for reasons relating to modern
slavery.
A third stage of assessment is in place for manufacturers of our own-brand (or no-brand, i.e. commodity) products; a site audit programme. For
a factory to be approved to manufacture on our behalf they need to pass site audits (which cover both technical and ethical components),
conducted by an approved independent 3rd party or, by exception, our own QA Managers. Where sites already hold the internationally-recognised
SMETA report for ethical assessment, these are accepted and reviewed by all of our businesses. Wickes moved all of its own and no brand site
ethical audits to SMETA during 2019. We work with our manufacturers to ensure that any major non-compliances are addressed before any
further activity is undertaken with them.
These three stages of assessment form our minimum expectation around supplier due diligence and work is ongoing to bring all Group
businesses and all centrally-controlled suppliers under this framework.
Additionally, over 97% of timber purchased by the Group in 2019 was certi ed as responsibly sourced (71% FSC and 26% PEFC). Both the FSC
and PEFC certi cation schemes require compliance with the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, 1998, prohibiting
the use of forced or child labour.

Risk areas and capacity building
Due to the complexity of our global operations, including the UK, we acknowledge that there is a risk of modern slavery in our supply chain. Our
risk assessment is informed by the Global Slavery Index, the Corruption Perceptions Index and the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) World Bank, taking into account both country-level and product-level risk. Product-level risk concerns the level of manual or seasonal labour
required to manufacture the product as the manual and temporary workforce is more exposed to risks of slavery. All suppliers will be assessed
against the new risk-pro ling tool during 2020.
We have provided training to key employees on modern slavery over a number of years, including the QA team and our direct sourcing team. The
online modern slavery training module is on our in-house training system which is accessible to all.

Identi ed incidents in 2019
A supervisor from a labour agency used by a product supplier to Travis Perkins and Wickes was found to be involved in the tra cking and
exploitation of migrant workers in 2015. Travis Perkins Group was informed in June 2019 once the authorities had completed their investigation
and convicted several members of a criminal tra cking network. The supplier undertook a full review and has implemented a number of
additional measures to protect the safety of its employees, including temporary seasonal workers from recruitment agencies. Travis Perkins
also completed an internal review and consulted with the supplier and Hope for Justice to understand their learnings and recommendations.
New procedures are being implemented to strengthen controls relating to agency workers, both within the Group and the supply chain.

Progress in 2019
Besides the continued evolution of our existing due diligence programmes (see the “Due diligence” section on p.2), in our 2018 statement we set
out our aim to improve in ve key areas. Progress made within the ve key areas is summarised below. Progress was also made in a sixth area;
labour agency due diligence.
Training & Capacity Building
We appointed a new Head of Sustainability in June 2019 who, as part of their role, leads on our efforts in tackling modern slavery and bringing
consistency to our approach across the businesses. New training modules will be launched in 2020 to all employees.
Risk Assessment
We revisited our risk assessment process to ensure that our mitigation efforts are applied most effectively. Product category risk is now also
taken into account, recognising that some product categories have supply chains which are more exposed to slavery risk.
Performance measurement
We set a KPI during 2019 on the completion of modern slavery training by our employees. To date, employees in higher-risk roles such as
Quality Assurance, Human Resources and Sourcing have completed training and the training modules are available to all employees.
Completion of the new training module will be mandatory for all employees. Progress will be reported at the end of 2020.

Partnerships & Communications
We became members of SEDEX through Wickes and this gives us access to extensive responsible sourcing data and knowledge. We
continued to support the Sustainable Supply Chain School and attended events by expert industry bodies to remain informed on best practice
in tackling modern slavery.
Policies & Systems
We began the transition to enhanced ethical auditing of own brand manufacturing sites. The business now accepts SMETA reports from its
sites where they are available and conducts an in-house audit (including ethical assessment) where they are not. The transition to enhanced
ethical auditing for all own and no brand (commodity) manufacturing sites will continue during 2020.
Labour agency due diligence
A greater level of control is being established with labour agencies providing manual labour into the Group’s distribution centres. Labour
agency contracts are being strengthened, with clear expectations around modern slavery due diligence. Checklists including the photograph
and name of each worker are provided by the labour agencies to allow the business to undertake one-off Right to Work checks. This gives
con dence to the business that the right workers are coming to our sites and that these workers are in possession of their own identi cation
documents.

Focus for 2020
Improved supplier risk assessment
Suppliers will be pro led using the risk-pro ling tool in order to best focus efforts for due diligence. Higher risk suppliers identi ed in the
pro ling exercise will then be required to complete the Online Risk Assessment, which will be relaunched with improved content taking into
account all relevant modern slavery risk types.
Continue transition to enhanced ethical site auditing
The move to enhanced ethical site auditing which started in 2019, whether through SMETA or an in-house enhanced ethical audit format, will
continue in 2020.
Launch of new training modules
Two new training modules will launch during 2020; one for all employees to raise general awareness and one for higher-risk roles to ensure
greater understanding and preparedness in the event of any concerns.
Collaboration with the supply chain
We will work with selected customers and suppliers and attend relevant events in order to share best practice, learn from others and support
industry-wide improvements.

We will continue to develop our approach, review our progress and publish an updated statement annually. This statement is approved by the Board of
Wickes Building Supplies Limited plc and its relevant subsidiaries in relation to the nancial period ending 31st December 2018.
This statement is approved by the Board of Travis Perkins plc and its relevant subsidiaries in relation to the nancial period ending 31st December 2019.

Modern Slavery Act Statement 2016
Samsung Electronics (UK) Limited supports the introduction of the UK Modern Slavery Act and its
efforts to combat slavery and human trafficking in global supply chains. Slavery and human
trafficking are abuses of a person’s freedoms and rights and these practices should be eradicated. As
a responsible business Samsung ensures that its employees and suppliers do not in any way support
these activities.
Samsung Electronics (UK) Limited has issued this statement pursuant to Part 6, Provision 54, of the
UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 for its financial year ending 31 December 2016. This statement
outlines the steps Samsung Electronics (UK) Limited has taken during that period to ensure that
slavery and human trafficking is not present in its organisation. In line with the provisions of the UK
Modern Slavery Act, this statement seeks to address the six recommended criteria listed in the
Regulations.

Organisational structure, our business and supply chain
Samsung Electronics (UK) Limited’s principal activities are the importation and distribution of
Samsung branded electronic and electrical goods. Samsung Electronics (UK) Limited’s operations
are predominantly based in the UK and Ireland with the exception of a research and development
facility in Israel.
Samsung Electronics (UK) limited is a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Co. Limited, a company
incorporated in the Republic of Korea. Samsung Electronics employs approximately 308,745
employees in 80 countries and maintains 199 worldwide hubs, including production and sales
subsidiaries, design centres, research centres, and 15 regional head offices worldwide. Products
distributed by Samsung Electronics (UK) Limited were purchased from Samsung Electronics Co.
Limited or its subsidiaries. References in this Statement to “Samsung” or “us” or “we” refer to
Samsung Electronics Co. Limited and its subsidiaries.
While approximately ninety percent of Samsung’s products are manufactured at Samsung-owned
facilities, we have a global network of approximately 2,500 tier-1 suppliers who are important to us,
and we work diligently to provide world-class working conditions throughout our global
manufacturing network and comply with local laws and regulations in all regions in which we
operate.

Policies and partnerships in relation to slavery and human trafficking
Samsung respects the guidelines of various international organizations and groups, and is an active
member of the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) and the Global e-Sustainability
Initiative (GeSI). Samsung complies with the EICC Code of Conduct - a set of standards on social,
environmental and ethical issues in the electronics industry supply chain. We also participate in

numerous activities through working groups, including the GeSI Human Rights Working Group, and
other stakeholder forums.
Samsung has established corporate policies to protect the rights of vulnerable individuals. In 2015,
we updated our ‘Business Conduct Guidelines’ based on the United Nations Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), which reinforces our commitment to the protection of
employees’ human rights, our prohibition policy on child labour, enforcement of involuntary labour
and cooperative labour-management relations. Samsung requires its suppliers to comply with the
‘Samsung Supplier Code of Conduct’ based on principles defined in the EICC Code of Conduct.
Furthermore, we have designed specific policies to protect socially vulnerable populations whose
basic labour rights were identified at risk of being violated as a key target for human rights
protection. In 2016, we developed guidelines for migrant workers in cooperation with BSR (Business
for Social Responsibility) to help eradicate forced labour, excessive commissions for employment,
and any discriminatory treatment which may occur for migrant workers in the supply chain. We also
worked with BSR and PIC (Partners in Change) to develop guidelines to protect the rights of
apprentices in India. This guidance builds upon our earlier collaborative engagement activities with
the CCR CSR (Center for Child Rights and Corporate Social Responsibility), in 2014, to develop and
implement our child labour prohibition policy in China.

Due diligence processes
To ensure adherence to our Business Conduct Guidelines and Supplier Code of Conduct, Samsung
adopts a three-stage process of self-assessments, on-site inspections and third party verifications.
Samsung operates a dedicated unit to manage the work environment of our worldwide organisation.
The unit, which operates at global corporate level, is responsible for assessing compliance
management practices, these include: managing labour and human rights, safety and health,
environment and ethics management. This unit works closely and collaboratively with relevant
business divisions to identify risks and to resolve them as quickly as possible.
Samsung conducts comprehensive corporate responsibility risk analysis at our own production
facilities, analysing various data accumulated through the internal management system. This allows
us to detect workplace-related risks early and ensure consistent implementation of our performance
standards. In addition, the workplace management team provides on-site consulting for high-risk
production sites identified through our due-diligence and corporate social responsibility (CSR) risk
assessments based on the EICC self-assessment tool. In 2016, all Samsung production sites
conducted a worksite risk self-assessment.
The self-assessment tool and audits are also critical components of our overall supplier management
process. In 2016 all tier-1 suppliers conducted self-assessments. Suppliers analysed their internal
CSR risk factors, selected areas of weakness as improvement tasks, and amended the identified
compliance gaps. Suppliers share information on improvement tasks with us through our intranet
database system, and we provide additional inputs on proposed tasks, if necessary.
We hold tier-1 suppliers accountable for building and supporting a responsible work environment at
tier-2 and/or lower tier suppliers and reflect these objectives in evaluating their performance. Our

standard tier-1 supplier contract stipulates that they are responsible for managing the work
environment of lower tier suppliers. Samsung offers consultative and investment support to tier-2
suppliers where work management practices have been reported as substandard.
For new suppliers, our worksite assessment unit conducts mandatory on-site assessments to
evaluate candidate standards. Labour rights are one of five core criteria that new suppliers must
satisfy for registration. The labour rights inspection consists of 20 performance criteria which
includes an examination of voluntary work, minimum wages, work hour regulation, child labour and
discrimination policies.

Risk management
To mitigate the risk of any incidences of non-compliance with the Samsung Supplier Code of
Conduct, we identify ‘priority suppliers’, considering their geopolitical location, transaction volumes,
historic performance and self-assessment evaluation. On-site audits are then conducted by our
EICC–certified auditors, operating independently from the procurement department, to identify
improvement tasks. In 2016, we conducted on-site audits on 362 suppliers to ensure the credibility
of self-assessments. Of these suppliers 95% achieved compliance by implementing improvement
tasks.
To achieve a higher level of compliance management Samsung also conducts third-party audits of
our suppliers through the verification agency registered with EICC. Suppliers subject to third-party
audits were randomly selected and the verification cost was sourced by Samsung. All identified
improvement tasks must be implemented within three months and closure audits are conducted to
ensure improvement tasks are met.
Each year, on-site audits are also conducted at Samsung worksites whose management processes
are found to be substandard or where labour rights issues are considered high risk. In 2016 11 such
worksites were audited, and a total of 227 improvement issues were identified. Three worksites have
successfully completed their improvement tasks and 211 tasks (93%) have been completed across
all 11 worksites. Third party audits of Samsung worksites are undertaken at the request of
customers. In 2016, 7 third party audits were conducted at Samsung worksites.
In addition to regular on-site audits, we perform unannounced and special audits by risk item,
including the employment of interns and student workers. In 2016 we ran inspections at 170
Chinese suppliers during vacation periods when children may be seeking employment. In December
2016 we also began on-site inspections of migrant worker practices at recruitment agencies and
suppliers in Thailand and Malaysia.
Samsung may impose penalties on the overall transactions, including restriction on product
development participation, for suppliers that fail to achieve improvement goals.

Measurement and performance standards
In an effort to promote greater transparency and accountability Samsung discloses the results of
third party supplier audits. In 2016, the results showed supplier performance improvements in
many major verification categories. However, the overall compliance rate for labour rights issues fell

slightly (92% - 90%), compared to previous years, due to challenges meeting compliance with work
hour standards and the guarantee of off-days. This performance was attributable to the increase in
the number of new models introduced in 2016. To address this issue, we have taken steps to ensure
that concerned suppliers hire additional staff, expand their facilities, improve their processes, and
practice the predictive management of overtime work so that they are able to comply with work
hour criteria. Furthermore, we monitor the weekly overtime work of all workers at those suppliers
who require monthly overtime work management, and continuously provide customised assistance
to help meet the work hour criteria of individual employees.
Samsung has developed a global grievance handling mechanism to identify potential violations of
any work environment standards or the infringement of human rights that could possibly occur with
our suppliers or at our worksites. We operate a variety of grievance handling channels (e.g. hotline,
offline and online channels) for suppliers and employees. Grievance reports are reviewed by our
responsible department and informants are notified of proposed solutions. Since 2016, the worksite
monitoring system has categorised the type of grievances reported (e.g. work environment, working
condition, etc.) and tracked their progress status and handling outcomes. For our worksites which
hire migrant workers we provide grievance handling channels in the mother language of these
employees to improve their accessibility. In 2016, we received a total of 9,278 worksite grievances
of which 98% were completely resolved. Samsung ensures that individuals that raise grievances are
not disadvantaged.

Training and capacity building
Samsung Electronics provides training to raise supplier awareness of human rights and improve
the work environment. Training modules include relevant best practices, based on the EICC Code
of Conduct. In addition to the Supplier Code of Conduct, Samsung also distributes a 'Supplier Code
of Conduct Guide' to ensure our clearly defined principles and policies are carried out in daily
business activities of our suppliers. The Guide is designed to improve understanding of the code
and provide detailed measures for integration of sustainability. We require that our suppliers sign a
pledge to indicate that they will implement these policies and to confirm their commitment to
voluntary compliance.
After announcing the guidelines for migrant workers in 2016, Samsung initiated a training
programme to keep its policy commitment and promote activities to manage the risks of forced
labour and human trafficking at high risk regions. We have begun delivering workshops with 1-tier
suppliers, labour sourcing companies and recruitment agencies in Malaysia and Thailand. The
programme marks a significant step in a concerted effort to address this issue, and a developing
programme of training, supported with on-site inspections, will continue to be provided in 2017.
To address the potential risk of suppliers employing underage workers in China, we train our
managers and the HR officers of our suppliers on our recruitment process so that identity checks
and face-to-face interviews are mandated for all applicants during the recruitment process. In doing
so, we support working-level capacity building to protect the human rights of these vulnerable
individuals.
Samsung also conducts a range of online training programmes which are provided by EICC to help
employees who are in charge of HR and supplier management at our production subsidiaries build

their capacity of human rights issues. Furthermore, we have developed mandatory training
programmes for all employees at our global production subsidiaries which include our policy on
human rights.

Further action
Samsung is committed to maintaining a sustainable and responsible supply chain. To continue to
mitigate against slavery and human trafficking taking place in our supply chain we will continue to
work collaboratively with our key stakeholders to refine and improve our policies, procedures and
programmes. We will continue to outline steps to tackle these issues in our annual sustainability
report and modern slavery statement.
Our Business Conduct Guidelines, Supplier Code of Conduct, Supplier Code of Conduct Guide,
Migrant Workers Guidelines, and our Sustainability Report are publically available.
This statement was approved by the Board of Samsung Electronics (UK) Limited.

Policies and partnerships
We have established a robust set of labour and human rights policies based on: Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights (UNGPs); Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines
for Multinational Enterprises; UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC); International
Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work; the ILO
Core Conventions. We abide by the Code of Conduct of the Responsible Business Alliance
2

(RBA) and comply with the laws and regulations of the countries where we conduct our
business.
The cornerstone of Samsung’s human rights and labour policies is its Global Code of Conduct
and Supplier Code of Conduct, which describe standards of integrity that Samsung worksites
and supply chain partners should meet respectively. Additional global policies which
demonstrate our commitment to responsible work practices, and which encompass issues
relating slavery and forced labour, include our Business Conduct Guidelines, Responsible
Sourcing of Minerals Policy, and our Migrant Worker Guidelines.
These policies are supported by a range of local policies where the risk of human rights and
labour issue violations have been identified and which require specific mitigation measures.
These policies are listed on Samsung.com and further information on the standards of
performance and integrity we require can be found in our 2020 Sustainability Report.

Successfully developing and delivering these policies often requires support and input from
civil society groups and industry peers. Key industry partners supporting Samsung have been
the RBA, who’s Code of Conduct underpins our own Business Conduct Guidelines and Supplier
Code of Conduct, and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), which supports efforts to
integrate social and environmental sustainability solutions through digital technologies.

Responsible Business Alliance
The RBA was created by global electronics companies to improve working and environmental
conditions. Samsung has been a member of the RBA since 2007 and takes an active role in the
organisation’s major programmes, including the RBA’s Responsible Labor Initiative, which is
focused on ensuring that the rights of workers vulnerable to forced labour in global supply
chains are consistently respected and promoted, and Responsible Minerals Initiative, which
develops tools and resources to investigate the use of conflict minerals and the certification
of compliant smelters. In addition to its activities as a full member, Samsung is supporting its
partner firms to understand their obligations, identify potential risks and set up responsible
management systems based on RBA guidelines. We use the RBA on-site audit protocols to
identify the working environment risks in labour, health and safety, environment, business
ethics, and management systems so we can implement corrective action plans.

Samsung also has a successful and long-standing record of working with a number of civil
society partners. In 2014, we worked with the CCR CSR (Center for Child Rights and Corporate
Social Responsibility), to develop and implement our child labour prohibition policy in China.
This work was followed by a collaboration with BSR (Business for Social Responsibility) and
PIC (Partners in Change) to develop our guidelines to protect the rights of apprentices in India,
and in 2016 we developed guidelines for migrant workers in cooperation with BSR.
BSR’s expertise was also used to support Samsung with its first human rights impact
assessment (HRIA). Undertaken in 2018 and completed in 2019, the HRIA was conducted in
order to seek objective information about our business impacts, and as part of a wider global
effort to align our internal practices with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business
and Human Rights: Protect, Respect, and Remedy. The insights from the HRIA are of great
value to Samsung, and action to turn learning into improvements has already begun.
Samsung continues to invest in multi-stakeholder initiatives. In 2018 we announced our
membership of the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM), which is funding
projects to increase the proportion of responsibly produced minerals from conflict-affected
and high-risk areas (CAHRAs). In 2019, working with the German development agency, GIZ,
and partners BMW Group, Samsung SDI and BASF, we launched Cobalt for Development, a
pilot project at an artisanal cobalt mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which aims to
promote responsible mining practices and improve conditions for the community. 2019 also
saw us collaborate with the International Organization of Migration (IOM), with whom we
delivered workshops on Modern Slavery and Ethical Recruitment to our employees, suppliers
and business partners at worksites from Hungary, Slovakia and Malaysia.
Since 2018, we have hosted multi-stakeholder forums in Vietnam as part of our efforts to
actively communicate and engage with our stakeholders. In 2019, we discussed women’s
rights and women's empowerment with the Vietnam General Federation of Labour (VGCL) and
the Center for Studies and Applied Sciences in Gender - Family - Women and Adolescents
(CSAGA). Various stakeholders, including the Vietnamese government, over 200 guests from
various NGOs, media, academia and experts, participated to share research findings and
opinions. The forum opened up a discussion on corporate policies, practices and implications
on preventing sexual harassment, women’s leadership, and women’s empowerment.
Efforts to support work on human rights and modern slavery extends to Samsung’s activities
in the UK. SEUK is a Board member of the digital technology trade association, techUK, and
participates in its Sustainable Supply Chain Group, which seeks to inform effective human
rights and labour policy through its engagement with Government and key stakeholders. In
2019, Samsung participated with other techUK members to peer review each other’s modern
slavery statements, as a mechanism to further improve industry reporting standards and
share best practices. The findings from this positive and constructive experience have helped
to inform this year’s statement. techUK aims to repeat this exercise again in 2020.

Due diligence processes
The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights places a
responsibility on companies to undertake human rights due
diligence. Samsung strongly supports this requirement and ensures
that we have a framework established and embedded across the
business to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for any adverse
human rights impacts. Samsung applies the same level of scrutiny
in assessing labour and human rights risks at its own operations to
those of its first-tier suppliers. Also, suppliers who are doing
business with us are obliged to apply our working environment
policies at the same level to their sub-suppliers.

Risk management systems
At SEUK we have conducted a review of our suppliers deemed to be at greater risk of having
modern slavery in their own operations and supply chain. This includes companies which
provide goods and services to SEUK where the prevalence of low-skilled, low paid labour may
exist. We continue to monitor supplier compliance and are working with internal teams to
strengthen our vendor evaluation system, to ensure that suppliers understand the labour and
human rights of workers and that they adhere to our corporate Supplier Code of Conduct.
Samsung adopts a three-stage risk management system (self-assessment, on-site audit and
third-party audit) to monitor and manage the work environment of our global manufacturing
operations and those of our suppliers. The annual assessments required at our factories and
at our suppliers are based on RBA standards which are reflected in our Business Conduct
Guidelines and our Supplier Code of Conduct.

Samsung worksite monitoring system
For our own operations, we operate a system that identifies and monitors factors that can
affect employee labour and human rights through a range of internal and external channels.
Our worksite monitoring system supports the enforcement of labour and human rights and
compliance management in areas such as working environment, workplace culture, operation
of representative bodies, and management of suppliers. The system, provided in 12 languages,
evaluates 55 items in seven areas, and is instrumental in identifying worksites that need inhouse expert consultation to strengthen capacity and improvements.
Based on assessment results of the worksites monitoring system, we select two to three
worksites every six months that require improvements. The audits, led by employees trained
in the RBA methodology, evaluate performance based on 139 criteria using RBA and Samsung
standards. Audit results are shared with worksite management teams and corrective actions
and improvement plans are established. We work closely with the sites to require monthly
progress of improvements to be reported via the worksite monitoring system.
In 2019, we worked with RBA approved auditing firms to assess compliance with local labour
laws and RBA assessment standards at ten production sites in four countries. Two of the
worksites in Brazil were the first Samsung facilities to have achieved the RBA’s ‘One Star’

5

award which requires a minimum RBA performance score of 160 and all priority findings
closed, a functioning worker’s forum, and having one or more trained RBA Certified Factory
Lead.

Vietnam: Human Rights Impact Assessment
From 2018 to 2019 in Vietnam, we conducted a Human Rights Impact Assessment (HRIA) based
on the three principles of UNGPs: Protection, Respect, and Remedy. For an objective review,
we identified potential labour and human rights risks with expert support of BSR through
employee interviews, document reviews and stakeholder engagement. Whilst we did not
detect any human rights violations in need of immediate action, we established remediation
and mitigation measures for areas where further progress could be made, using
recommendations from BSR. As part of our continuous improvement efforts, we share our
findings, recommendations, and multiyear action plan with the stakeholders involved and
interested in our HRIA.
Whilst efforts to manage the impacts and risks of labour and human rights are generally
managed by local teams with the appropriate skills and competencies, oversight of Samsung’s
risk management systems on human rights and labour issues rests with our Global Labour
Issues (GLI) Committee. The GLI Committee, which convenes bi-weekly to discuss labour and
human rights issues, consists of executives and working-level employees from five functions
(Human Resources Team, Legal Office, Partner Collaboration Centre, Global Public Affairs
Team, Global EHS Team). Any important matters that require measures and actions to take are
escalated to the Sustainability Council, which consists of key executives, and then reported to
top management.

Managing the working environment of our suppliers
The self-assessments conducted at first-tier suppliers evaluates performance against 85
criteria. Information on the location, transaction volumes and historic compliance
performance of suppliers also influences the requirement for an on-site audit.
In 2019, 365 suppliers were selected for on-site audits. The average compliance rate of audited
suppliers was 95%. All audit improvement plans were registered on our Global Supplier
Relationship Management (G-SRM) System to enable performance of outstanding tasks to be
monitored. During this period, we also conducted special audits on forced labour at suppliers
in China, Mexico and Malaysia.
The audits conducted in China and Mexico focussed on use of child/underage labour. In total
185 suppliers were audited and there were no policy violations related to the use of
child/underage labour. However, where improvements were identified, corrective steps were
required and subsequently monitored by designated independent assessment managers
within Samsung Electronics as a separate task without the involvement of the procurement
team. In Malaysia, audits focussed on the employment of migrant workers. The investigation
of 17 suppliers established whether recruitment fees and the collection of IDs were being
demanded from workers, and also examined worker accommodation. Improvement measures

6

and corrective action plans were developed for suppliers that were deemed to be failing
Samsung’s strict standards of compliance.
Samsung’s third-party audits are conducted by RBA approved auditing firms. In 2019, we
increased the number of suppliers subject to these unannounced third-party audits in which
specific schedules were not provided in advance to prevent any kind of preliminary
preparation prior to the inspection, particularly in the Southeast Asia region, where migrant
worker concerns were raised in 2018. Closure audits ensure that corrective actions are
achieved.

Measurement and performance standards
We recognise that a grievance, understood as a perceived injustice evoking an individual’s or
a group’s sense of entitlement according to UNGPs, can be any kind of proposal or claim raised
by our employees, including complaints about their working environment. Our grievance
resolution procedure is based on the ‘Effectiveness criteria of non-judicial grievance
mechanisms’ as stipulated by the 31st clause of the UNGPs. Our employees and suppliers have
access to such procedure.
We operate four types of grievance resolution channels: hotline, online, offline channels, and
employee committees, and encourage anyone to raise their concerns free of discrimination.
All channels are provided in the native language of the respective country, and worksites
employing migrant workers are provided with information on grievance resolution channels
in their native languages.
Our four stage grievance resolution procedure provides the framework to enable the fair,
timely and transparent treatment of grievances that emerge in the workplace. Each stage of
the process has defined criteria and a performance timeframe. Where it has not been possible
to meet the intended resolution timeframe, the reporter of a grievance will be notified of the
reason for the delay. Workers can contest the results of a grievance resolution at any time.
In 2019, a total of 11,828 grievances were reported through our grievance resolution channels.
The number of grievances has declined over the past three years. In particular, the number of
grievances regarding working environment decreased by 1,462 (33%) from 4,403 in 2017 to
2,941 in 2019. As part of our efforts to provide a better working environment in 2019, we
established a healthcare centre in Vietnam, installed reflectors for worksite safety in Brazil,
expanded resting spaces and remodelled restrooms in Slovakia, and upgraded the company's
cafeteria in Russia.
Samsung values the opinion of external stakeholders and promotes a number of reporting
channels to enable constructive dialogue on work environment standards or the infringement
of human rights at our worksites, and our suppliers’ worksites. We operate the Samsung
Electronics' Global Business Ethics & Compliance system (www.sec-audit.com), corporate
hotline (+82-2255-0114), and global communication address (civilsociety@Samsung.com), to
listen to the opinions of various external stakeholders. We continually evaluate the

7

effectiveness of our internal and external grievance procedures, and seek to improve
accessibility and system design where necessary.
Samsung welcomes the opportunity to benchmark itself against its industry peers and actively
engages with respected organisations using benchmarking as a tool to raise standards and
practices that protect workers’ rights. In 2019, we were included in the Corporate Human
Rights Benchmark for ICT manufacturing – 40 of the largest ICT companies in the world were
assessed against the CHRB’s ICT manufacturing methodology. Samsung was pleased to rank
4th amongst our competitors but recognises, that whilst this result serves as a good starting
point, more work is needed to achieve greater success. As a result, we are reviewing
opportunities to further improve our human rights governance, policies and practices,
including efforts to monitor forced labour.
As reported in previous statements, Samsung conducts third-party supplier audits and
monitors and reports performance against five established indicators: labour and human
rights, health & safety, environment, ethics, and management systems.
Responding to migrant worker issues identified in the region in 2018, the 2019 third-party
supplier audits were predominantly conducted at worksites in South East Asia. Overall
compliance for 2019 remained consistently high with performance matching results for 2017
and 2018 at 96%. However, a small reduction in performance was recorded on labour and
human rights compliance in 2019 (93%) compared to 2018 (95%). The launch of new high
specification models and the relocation of global production sites did influence compliance.
Several new suppliers were also found to have work environment policies which failed to
adequately reflect updates to local laws and regulations. Working in partnership with these
suppliers we have provided support to resolve these issues.

Training and capacity building
To comply with our labour and human rights policies and raise employees’ awareness, we have
developed training programmes tailored to the characteristics of workplaces and are
strengthening our regular training for our employees every year. In 2019, 96% of employees
at overseas production subsidiaries and 100% of employees in South Korea completed training
programmes. We especially strengthened our training program in South Korea with modules
on anti-discrimination, bullying, and sexual harassment in the workplace.
As mentioned earlier in this statement, in
2019, working in cooperation with the
International Organization for Migration
(IOM), we provided specialised training on
protecting migrant workers at worksites
from Hungary, Slovakia and Malaysia.
Delivered in five educational modules:
Understanding modern slavery and migrant
workers; National laws and regulations
related to migrant workers; Management

8

policies for migrant workers in subsidiaries; Corporate efforts to eradicate forced labour; and,
Measures to end forced labour and remedies for victims, the training was provided to our
human resource personnel, as well as those from our suppliers and recruitment agencies.
According to statistics from the IOM and the Walk Free Foundation, Eastern Europe and
Central Asia have the highest rates of modern slavery, with an estimated 3.6 million victims
(91% of these individuals are believed to be victims of forced labour). Recognising that
forced labour remains a critically important global issue, Samsung will continue to seek
support from IOM to protect vulnerable workers throughout its supply chain.
Going forward into 2020, Samsung intends to further enhance training and capacity building
on labour and human rights, and we are currently working with BSR to deliver this provision
to all employees, including those in manufacturing, supervisors, and management. The
training is intended to be designed and tailored to include content which is targeted to specific
job functions and capacity. However, each training programme should contain key modules
on labour and human rights issues, including: the labour and human rights entitlements of
employees; the importance of labour and human rights; Samsung’s corporate responsibilities
and employees’ responsibilities; and delivering labour and human rights in practice. Further
information on this exercise will provided in next year’s modern slavery statement.

Management approval
Samsung is committed to complying with local laws and regulations and applies its global
code of conduct to all employees. We understand that acting responsibly builds trusting and
valued relationships with our stakeholders, which provides a strong and stable platform for
sustainable growth. This modern slavery statement has sought to demonstrate our continued
commitment and development to labour and human rights, and our efforts to mitigate the risk
of modern slavery and human trafficking in our operations and global supply chain. It
reaffirms Samsung’s ambition to become one of the most ethical companies in the world, and
to continue to train its employees and operate monitoring systems to deliver a fair and
transparent system of corporate management.
This Statement was approved by the Board of SEUK in June 2020. It complies with the
requirements set out in section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015.

Manor Fresh remains completely committed to achieving an ethical supply chain that
is free from all forms of worker exploitation. We recognise the challenge is difficult and
we are committed to work in partnership with our supply chain partners to deliver
whatever is reasonably practicable to mitigate potential risks.
Risks that we have identified have seen significant improvement to date and we are
committed to continue to reduce these further. Likewise, we expect suppliers to
Manor Fresh, both direct and as a part of our wider supply chain, to adopt similar
values and support our efforts throughout their own supply chains. We appreciate that
only through close collaboration will be able to combat modern slavery and human
trafficking.
During the last year we have mitigated identified risks, significantly improved
awareness training and made good procedural progress. We intend to continue this
work in line with our evolving ethical strategy.
Organisational structure
Manor Fresh Ltd is a privately owned business involved in the supply of high quality
vegetable and potatoes to leading UK retailers and food service customers.
Our business began trading as a new corporate entity in April 2006 following a merger
between two previously established UK based fresh produce companies. We have a
focused and multi-disciplined management team who are familiar with site policies and
procedures relating to potential Modern Slavery issues and challenges.
Our business
Manor Fresh supplies its customers with a broad range of pre-packed fresh potatoes
and vegetables. Our business has an annual turnover of approximately £54 million
pounds and directly employs around 160 people.
In addition, at certain times of the year, we engage smaller numbers of temporary
workers through supply agreements with fully accredited and licensed agency labour
providers.
Our supply chains
Manor Fresh works closely with its customers, growers and suppliers who are
predominantly based in the UK. We operate from a base near Holbeach, South
Lincolnshire.

In addition to our Holbeach operations, we work closely with carefully chosen strategic
UK based fresh produce growers and a limited number of overseas suppliers, as fresh
produce seasonal and regional supply dynamics require. Due to the relatively broad
range of vegetable and potato products that our business deals with on a daily basis,
we recognise that we need to continue working closely with our growers in an attempt
to improve overall standards and compliance.
Our approach to addressing the issues of Modern Slavery
Manor Fresh are committed to operating in a progressive and responsible manner in
order to systematically reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking within our
business and associated fresh produce supply chains.
We work hard across our whole business supply base to embed further the positive
principles of fairness, employee safety and ethical awareness that are pillars of our
business.
We regularly review and improve upon existing practices and strive to identify those
areas within our business where more work and focus can deliver sustainable and
further improvements.
We consult and collaborate with government agencies, law enforcement, regulatory
authorities and charities as well as our supply chain partners, sharing both intelligence
and experience.
Current activities
In the past 12 months, Manor Fresh has collaborated with customers, suppliers,
enforcement bodies, government and NGO s to share best practice and improve our
intelligence networks. In total, through our collaborative efforts, we have engaged
separately with over 130 organisations and raised awareness with over 1800 people
from outside of the Manor Fresh business.
A bespoke scorecard has been developed and deployed within our business such that
we can measure and appraise the progress that we are making in respect of those
risks we identify.
Our staff have also been active in the wider sphere of interest and influence and have
collaborated on a number of much wider projects relating to modern slavery and
human trafficking.
A GLAA video developed in collaboration with Manor Fresh continues to receive ‘hits’
on YouTube and has now received over 10,000 views.
Measuring our effectiveness
During the past 12 months, Manor Fresh’s compliance score against our supplier risk
assessment scorecard has shown an improvement of 4% with the biggest areas of
improvement being within due diligence and supply chain awareness training.
Against our key scorecard supply chain measurements, we have seen improvements
in 51 supply chain areas, no change in 2 areas and a decline in scores in 14 areas.
Our continuous improvement ethos and methodology is deployed to manage
performance in these challenging areas.

Through our efforts and profile, Manor Fresh continues to be acknowledged as a
leading positive ‘industry force’ within this challenging area.
Manor Fresh remains the only UK labour user to have been formally recognised by
their main retail customer (M&S) and the GLAA for their work in tackling Modern
Slavery since 2000.
Despite previous progress regarding building overall awareness of Modern Slavery
across our people and broader business activities, it is increasingly clear that the
insidious challenge of Modern Slavery within the UK has far from diminished and
remains a significant area of focus for us.
Training of our staff
The ongoing training and increased awareness of modern slavery and human
trafficking is a key priority for the Manor Fresh business.
Due to the amount of focus within our business, we have developed our own training
courses and structure, which we adapt and deliver on a ‘live’ and ongoing basis to
both new and existing colleagues as new risks and tactics of the traffickers emerge.
We actively encourage all our staff to be constantly vigilant and to report any concerns
they might have to management. We also provide a confidential and anonymous
telephone hotline service.
Going forward, Manor Fresh will continue to work with our staff members, supply
partners and relevant agencies to actively investigate any suspected instances of
slavery or human trafficking. We and our supply chain partners continue to make
positive progress but we understand that there is and will continue to be much work
still to be done if we are to help combat this abhorrent crime.
Board approval
This statement has been approved by our Board of Directors, who will review and
update it annually.

Financial Year 2018-19
This statement is being published in accordance with section 54(1) of the UK Modern
Slavery Act 2015. It covers the financial year commencing 1 July 2018 and ending 30 June
2019.
Research developed by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the Walk Free
Foundation, and the International Office for Migration (IOM) suggests that more than 40
million people around the world were victims of modern slavery in 2016, with almost 25
million of those victims exploited in forced labour – the most common element of modern
slavery. The UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 looks to tackle this international atrocity, by
making large UK companies accountable for the workers in their supply chains, where
modern slavery is often hidden. The Act requires companies to publish an annual report
setting out the steps being taken to ensure that
trafficked men, women and children are not
operating in their supply chains and to give details
of any due diligence being conducted to avoid
forced, bonded, or slave labour.
There have been many reported instances of
slavery globally in the farming, agricultural, and
fishing industries, including in the UK, making this
a highly pertinent issue to Bidfresh. Although the
group has a zero tolerance approach to
conducting business with any organisation that
knowingly utilises any form of modern slavery, we
know that due diligence and collaboration with
suppliers must occur to detect and remedy any
labour abuses potentially hidden further down the
chain.

ORGANISATION STRUCTURE AND SUPPLY CHAINS

Bidfresh is a specialist seafood, meat, produce and dairy supplier with a decentralised model
of management which encourages the entrepreneurial spirit contained in each of its
businesses. Businesses retain their local brand, tone of voice, look, and feel. However,
many of the back office functions - including ethical trade and food safety - are centralised.
We currently consist of 13 sites and 17 brands across the UK, supplying to chefs,
restaurants, food service, and a small amount direct to consumer via seafood and meat
concessions in Selfridges Oxford St. A full list of our businesses and brands can be found on
our website, www.bidfresh.co.uk.

Staff: Bidfresh employs 2 staff specifically in ethical trade, as well as distributing some of the
ethical responsibilities throughout Buying and Food Safety roles.
The first of the roles is the Ethical Analyst, who is solely dedicated to ethical trade. The
Ethical Analyst's responsibility is the implementation of the ETI Base Code throughout
business practices, ensuring the safety and protection of workers throughout the business
and supply chains. In Sept '18, Bidfresh created a new role of Sustainability & Ethics
Manager, where approximately half of the role is dedicated to overseeing ethical trade
strategy, policies, procedures, and reporting. Food Safety and Buying roles are responsible
for collecting ethical information from proposed new suppliers as well as supporting
involvement in supplier projects.
The Ethical Analyst reports into the Sustainability & Ethics Manager, who in turn reports
directly to the CEO, with frequent links to the Head of Food Safety and Board of Directors.
Senior-level involvement in ethical trade is driven by Bidfresh's CEO who holds a Masters in
Sustainability. He understands the critical link between ethics/sustainability and good
business, and wishes to ensure that these activities keep a high profile across the Group.

Ethical Trading Initiative
In December 2014, while operating as Seafood Holdings, the seafood businesses joined
the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), ‘a leading alliance of companies, trade unions and NGOs
that promotes respect for workers' rights around the globe.’ A critical aspect of membership
is reporting on ethical trade performance, so that the ETI can monitor progress over time
and ensure continuous improvement. New ETI members are called ‘Foundation Members’
and are given 2 years to submit their first report.
After completing our first Foundation period, in May 2017, our ETI membership (along with
our overall ethical trade scope) was expanded from our seafood division to all of Bidfresh,
adding meat, dairy and produce to the remit. This was a significant commitment as it
increased the number of suppliers in scope from about 300 to just under 1000, and tested
our ethical trading systems which were originally built for seafood supply chains. It also
returned us to Foundation stage.
At the completion of this financial year, in late June 2019, we submitted our Foundation
report for Bidfresh – much of which has been used to construct this Statement. We are
pleased to report that, as of October 2019, we have progressed once again to Full
membership.

Supply Chains: The majority of our tier 1 suppliers are UK-based, which reflects a priority
across the Group to source fresh, locally and seasonally wherever possible. However we
also have a number of important products such as seasonal produce, prawns and squid
which come from the EU and overseas.
The supply chain structures within Bidfresh vary depending on the business division. For
example, a complicated fish supply chain may involve vessels who engage in transhipment,
offload to a freezer or cannery, and then ship overseas to one of our depots; whereas a
complicated meat supply chain may include different farms for breeding, rearing, fattening,
and abattoirs before being packed and shipped to the UK. In more simple cases, we
purchase directly from local farmers or fish markets in the UK. All of these different stages in
supply chains may have different human rights issues associated with them.

POLICIES IN RELATION TO SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING

The key policies that we maintain in relation to modern slavery are:
 Ethical Trading Policy: This policy confirms our commitment as ETI Members to the
9 principles of the ETI Base Code. It is signed off by Bidfresh’s CEO and states that
we will uphold these principles throughout our business and supply chains.
 Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy: This expands on our ethical trading
policy to build on our Base Code commitments and to link into our due diligence
procedures. The policy applies to our own business as well as our suppliers:
o Scope includes all persons working for Bidfresh or on our behalf in any
capacity
o Includes a confidential reporting helpline and a requirement to notify us
immediately if any labour rights issues arise in the business or supply chains
o Includes specific prohibitions with the option to terminate a relationship if
suppliers or individuals violate the policy, do not show an intention to improve
or are complicit in modern slavery and/or human trafficking.
Also relevant to ethical trade is the Traceability Policy, which states:
It is the policy of the company to ensure adequate identification of all raw materials,
including primary packaging, work in process products, finished products, products in
storage and any product on hold to ensure effective traceability.
The traceability data available due to this policy means that we are able to map any highpriority supply chains to first tier and raw material source. All approved suppliers must have
BRC accreditation (minimum ‘A’ grade) and/or be able to provide evidence of a recent
traceability exercise.
The ETI Base Code is communicated to all suppliers who are asked to sign a copy for our
records during the supplier approval procedure – this is to ensure they are aware of the
ethical code Bidfresh adhere to and also the standard of ethics we expect from all suppliers.
Internally, all employees are made aware of the ETI Base Code via posting in depots. They
are also given access to the Bidfresh Employee Handbook which contains information on
holidays/absence, rules, health & safety, equal opportunities, grievance procedures,
harassment & bullying, and termination procedures.

4

We are currently in the process of writing our first Remediation Policy, which details what
would occur if forced labour, child labour, or any human rights abuse which puts workers at
risk of life and limb were found in our operations or supply chains. To build this, we have
reviewed best practice guides such as the ETI guidance on Access to Remedy and the UN
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (where section 3 focuses on remedy).
In addition, the Ethics team are in the process of revising the Ethical Trade Policy to clarify
our expectations of suppliers – e.g. when an audit is required, the audit schemes we accept,
the Bidfresh audit scheme (more in Section III), grievance procedures, freedom of
association, and the Employer Pays Principle. The revised policy will be published in
FY2019-20.
Food Network for Ethical Trade

In February 2019, we joined the Food Network for Ethical Trade (FNET), furthering our
commitment to labour rights. FNET is a UK alliance of over 35 suppliers, retailers and
brands working together to identify common human rights risks and to combat them. It is a
member-driven organisation aiming to identify, manage and respond to global food supply
ethical trade risks. FNET also supports and facilitates opportunities for collaboration among
suppliers who wish to share best practice on tackling labour rights issues.
FNET operates through three collaborative work streams: Risk Assessment & Mitigation,
Collaborations, and Supply Chain Engagement. Bidfresh has already made use of a
number of FNET tools created by these work streams including a product- and countryspecific risk assessment tool and buyer training on the benefits of ethical trade. Our FNET
participation ensures that our ethical trade system will remain up-to-date and continue to
improve in the future.

III.

DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES

The Company monitors and evaluates its suppliers based on their commitment to ethical
trade and compliance with the ETI Base Code.
The due diligence procedure is normally conducted during the approval process for a new
supplier, and updated at least on a biennial basis. For suppliers who were approved prior to
the ethical trade system’s introduction, the Ethical Analyst has been manually contacting
each supplier to carry out the procedure.

5

Our main ethical due diligence process for suppliers is as follows:

Ethical Trade Decision Tree for Buyers:
Details the ethical information that needs to be collected from supplier in advance of
supplier approval

Supplier is sent a copy of
our Anti-Slavery &
Human Trafficking
Agreement

Supplier completes our
Ethical SAQ containing
questions on management
systems, training, nature of
workforce, and their
suppliers

Supplier is sent a copy of
ETI Base Code to sign and
return

See full details in Section IV

Completed Ethical SAQ and Base Code are returned to Ethical Analyst,
who uses Procedure 101-Risk Assessment to risk assess the SAQ

Risk rating assigned to supplier (High / Medium / Low) and any
required follow-up carried out with the supplier
See full details in Section IV

As a last resort, if high-risk suppliers are uncooperative or
knowingly operating illegally, they are escalated to senior
management and placed under review for delisting

6

Supply Chain Mapping is another part of our due diligence. The process is as follows:

High priority ethical issue relevant to our
supply chains is detected (e.g. through
ETI membership, news, industry events)
Procedure 102-Supply Chain Mapping
is triggered

All Tier 1 suppliers supplying the
product being mapped return a Supply
Chain Mapping Form to collect
information on further tiers of the supply
chain
The various supply chains, tiers, and
actors are visually mapped using Prezi
See an example in Section IV below

Risk ratings are assigned to each actor
in the supply chain (High / Medium /
Low) and Tiers 2 and beyond are
contacted as necessary (via the Tier 1
supplier) to collect further information or
carry out any required remediation

As a last resort, if high-risk suppliers are
uncooperative or knowingly operating
illegally, they are escalated to senior
management and placed under review
for delisting

Currently all due diligence is carried out via desktop. We are initiating the Bidfresh audit
programme in FY2019-20, beginning with social auditor training for the central Buying, Food
Safety and Ethical Trade teams – those who most often visit sites. This will increase our
engagement with suppliers whilst encouraging stronger, more trusting supplier relationships.
All of the Bidfresh sites have our internal Fraud & Ethics Hotline on display, which anyone
can contact anonymously at any time. The hotline is for reporting incidents such as
suspected fraud and unethical behaviour, bullying, human trafficking, and slavery, either
within our business or that of our suppliers. The line is monitored by an anonymous
dedicated member of staff who deals with and escalates each issue as appropriate.

7

IV.

RISK ASSESSMENT, PREVENTION & MITIGATION

The Ethical Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) was designed in 2016 by an
independent, external consultant experienced in seafood & ethical trade. The questions
cover the topics determined to hold the highest risks of non-compliance against the ETI
Base Code, as follows:
Country of Origin – Sites based in countries with weak labour laws score higher
than others.
Industry Risk – What type of food they supply (i.e. frozen fish = high risk).
Own Brand Risk – Whether we sell the product under our own brand.
Supply Chain Risk – Amount of suppliers into that supplier, and in what countries
they are based.
Policy on Slavery Risk – Whether they have an internal modern slavery policy.
Ethical Auditing Risk – Whether they conduct internal ethical audits on themselves
and/or on their suppliers.
Management Systems Risk – Whether they have management systems in place to
tackle the risk of slavery in their supply chain.
Migrant Labour Risk - Suppliers that use a high volume of migrant labour,
particularly those that include foreign employees not under collective agreement,
score higher than others.
Insecure Workers Risk – If any of the workforce is unskilled, temporary and/or
seasonal, they are at a higher risk of labour abuses.
Agency Workers Risk - Foreign workers and/or staff employed under temporary
contracts who are engaged by foreign or local temporary staffing agencies score
higher than others.
Training Risk – Whether staff are trained in Health & Safety and their rights, and to
what extent.
Freedom of Association Risk – Whether suppliers have a collective bargaining
agreement, trade unions or workers’ committees.
Accommodation Risk – Suppliers who provide onsite accommodation are at a
higher risk for non-conformance against the Base Code.

The consultant also helped to develop Procedure 101-Risk Assessment which contains
the risk ratings for all possible responses in the SAQ, ensuring consistency. When an Ethical
SAQ is returned by a supplier, their response to each question is assigned a score from 1
(lowest risk) to 5 (highest risk) according to the Procedure. Scores are totalled at the end to
give an overall risk rating for the supplier:
Low: 13-26

Medium: 27-39

High: 40-65

8

If a High Risk supplier is found, the Ethical Analyst will ask questions, gather further
information, and make suggestions to reduce the risk level. The Company requests copies of
ethical audit reports and, if available, reviews to assess whether any follow-up can occur to
reduce the risks identified – for example, by sharing templates for a supplier’s first Ethical
Trade Policy, or advising that multilingual posters of the Base Code are posted on site.
Our Ethical SAQ and Risk Assessment Procedure are undergoing a significant update in
FY2019-20 to make use of the FNET Risk Assessment Tool, incorporating country, product,
industry, and labour risks alongside priority and leverage. This will help us to strategically
determine where it will be most effective for us to engage on-the-ground, and will more
accurately identify the higher risk parts of our supply chains.
CASE STUDY: Tuna Transhipment
In the seafood industry, transhipment is known to increase risk of potential Illegal, Unreported
and Unregulated (IUU) fishing and labour abuses.
Transhipment is when catch and/or supplies are moved between the fishing vessel to another
‘carrier’ vessel, which then usually returns to port to offload catch. This is a fairly common
practice for tuna vessels in the Western Central Pacific, where the Company sources from.
Particularly when conducted in the open ocean, it increases risk because the fishing vessel does
not have to return to port to offload catch or replenish supplies. This means that fishermen could
be kept at sea for months at a time; it also obscures traceability of the catch, which may lend
cover to IUU fishing.

When the Company became aware of transhipment and its risks via external peer events and
news articles, Procedure 102-Supply Chain Mapping was triggered. We aimed to remove
transhipment at sea from our supply chains wherever possible, and at a minimum to ensure it is
properly documented and monitored by officials.
Through the mapping process, we began to ask for more information – can suppliers provide
catch certificates, vessel details, catch date & time, transhipment records, and any information
on working conditions for fishermen?
Through the process, we uncovered one supplier who, despite repeated efforts to communicate
and collaborate, was not willing to provide any additional information. Therefore, the supply chain
mapping procedure illustrated in Section IV was executed to the final step, and the supplier was
delisted. We have now moved to a supplier who is committed to providing traceability
information, reducing transhipment where possible, and conducting regular risk assessments for
IUU and traceability.

Through the company’s due diligence procedure, we have completed a number of supply
chain maps:
 Warm water shrimp
 Frozen squid
 Frozen, fresh and ambient tuna
 Frozen and fresh haddock
 Frozen and fresh cod
 Potato
 Peruvian asparagus
 Italian tomatoes
 Spanish strawberries
 Brazilian & Argentinian beef (see image below)

The potential labour rights violations associated with these products are the most detrimental
to workers, including the most severe breaches of the ETI's Base Code such as forced
labour, child labour, harsh and inhumane treatment, unhygienic and unsafe working
conditions and excessive working hours. A few of these (cod, haddock, and potatoes) have
been mapped because of the sheer volume we trade of these products, rather than specific
associated labour rights issues.
There are risks we are aware of where we have limited visibility and/or influence to address.
Fishing vessels are an example of this – they can be far removed from us in the supply chain
which means we have less visibility and influence over the conditions of workers. This raises
concerns as they can be out at sea for many weeks or even months with limited oversight e.g. only vessels of a certain size are required to have observers, and fewer still have
electronic observers (webcams). We are working to address this issue in a less direct way:
our Sustainability Director sits on the review panel for the Responsible Fishing Scheme, a
vessel-based standard including both sustainability and working conditions, currently being
expanded so that it may be applied worldwide.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS TO MEASURE EFFECTIVENESS

Significant progress has been made in expanding the scope of the Company’s ethical trade
programme beyond seafood to all divisions including meat, dairy, and produce. This was
alongside the expansion of our ETI membership to the entire Company in 2017.
The Ethical Analyst, in place from May 2018, began carrying out the ethical due diligence
procedures within the meat, dairy and produce businesses, as well as continuing on seafood
suppliers. The graph below illustrates the progress of tier 1 suppliers risk assessed (and tier
2 where an agent is present) since the last report. Over 80% of the Group suppliers have
now been risk assessed.

Below are the objectives we set out in our ETI report submitted in July 2019, at the close of
the financial year to which this Statement pertains. Completing the ETI report has allowed us
to clarify what we are working towards as well as to establish time-bound activities that will
help us achieve the objectives. In future reporting, we (and the ETI) will measure our
success against the completion of these activities and objectives, according to the timelines
set out. The ultimate objective of all of these is a stepwise approach to continuous
improvement in ethical trade.

CED Stone Group
Modern Day Slavery Statement 2019
CED have produced this statement in line with and in recognition of Section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015. It describes and links to
our ethical strategy, targets and current actions in relation to prevention of Modern Day Slavery and forced labour, in our supply-chain.
Forced labour includes the range of activities such as recruiting, concealing, transporting or obtaining workers where a person uses force or

physical threats, psychological control or other deceptive means to compel someone to work. CED make it clear to all our supply chain
partners that any form of Modern Day Slavery, forced labour, debt bondage, child labour or any other act of forcing workers to do something
against their will and where they have no choice, is totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated under any circumstance. Other human
rights abuses go “hand in hand” with Modern Day Slavery and our strategy is to monitor our supply-chain factories and watch for any
warning signs or “red ags” that suggest there could be ethical trade issues present.

Natural Stone Industry background:
Natural stone production worldwide has some very complex supply chains. There can be some very good visibility at tier one
factory level but much less further down the chain at sub-contract and quarry level. Due to the weight, awkwardness and cost of
moving raw natural stone quarry blocks they are often processed into nished products at factories located beside the quarry
source. In large countries such as China, this means that a lot of production occurs at partner factories to the actual suppliers, that
importers are dealing directly with. Also as with other industries there can be a substantial amount of sub-contract work done, as
jobs are shared by neighbouring factories to manage lead-times. There are seasonal “highs and lows” in our market place and this
can mean that there is a substantial amount of labour who are temporary and not employed directly by the factory. These
temporary workers are often in a much more vulnerable position than the permanent workers, being less likely to have formal
contracts or insurance cover and are more at risk of suffering labour rights abuses. Often it is illegal and unchecked mines and
quarries that can be responsible for bonding workers. Ultimately it will be the build up of pressure on local and national
Government bodies, to ensure enforcement of local and International Labour Organisation laws, that will bring about the necessary
changes. When you drill down into the whole concept and reasoning behind the Modern Day Slavery Act, it is to protect the
workers that produce the goods that we consume here in the UK. When you buy something that costs very little it is probably the
case that the workers who produced the product are being taken advantage of in some way. Low pay, long hours, physical and
verbal abuse, forced and slave labour are all the more likely. It is a conundrum which is hard to solve. We all look for a bargain but
do not always consider the cost. In our industry when the contractors have the orders to place, their buyers have the job of nding
the cheapest price. Our investment in Ethical work and the fact that we will only trade with ethically supportive factories, means
that there is an extra overhead to be considered. The more pressure that the UK consumers place on business and Government to
demand evidence of ethical sourcing the better. This is the best way forward for sustainable change.

CED Ethical Supply Structure:
CED Stone Group always strives to lead by example in the way that we conduct ourselves and the fair way we interact and impact with our
suppliers. We are conscious of the footprint that we leave and work hard to ensure that our purchasing and business practices have only
positive effects on the workers in our supply-chain. It has been key that we map our supply-chain to the fullest extent to ensure that we
know where our stone comes from and where it is being worked, so that we can assess the conditions that workers producing our goods
work under. We source much of our imports from factories in both China and India. Through research and mapping we identi ed these as
our highest risk areas and have targeted the majority of our ethical resources there. We also source stone products from across Europe and
the UK. We continue to be vigilant and monitor these operations too, so that we can ensure that there is no forced or slave labour present
and that workers have the freedom to leave their employer if they choose to do so. Company size is important when it comes to how much
in uence one can realistically exert on supplier factories. However CED Stone do not see this as an excuse for any acceptance of Modern
Day Slavery.. We rigorously inspect and audit supplier sites to look for signs that human rights abuses are, or might be present. Experience
has taught us that collaboration and multiple stake-holder programmes, are the best way to in uence improvements in regions, where our
business levels, methods and reach alone, cannot affect any positive ethical change.

ETI Membership:
The Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) is a leading alliance of Commercial Companies, Trade Unions and NGOs, that promotes respect for
workers rights around the globe. Their vision is a world where all workers are free from exploitation and discrimination, and enjoy conditions
of freedom, security and equity. Global supply chains are highly complex and challenging for companies committed to eradicating Modern
Day Slavery. Workers rights issues are often deep-rooted and widespread and are best tackled through collaborative action. Through our
involvement with ETI we are able to harness the expertise, skills and resources of their alliance members to identify these issues and help
develop innovative, long-lasting solutions. We have been full and active members of ETI for several years and work on the collaborative
project as part of the Rajasthan Sandstone Working Group. We believe that working with ETI and their Base Code of labour practices, is an
essential for companies who are serious about Ethical Trade and eradicating Modern Day Slavery. The level of experience and knowledge
that their tripartite of members bring and of which members have access to is vast and invaluable. They lead, guide and monitor their
members and ensure that you are always thinking forward and working to resolve issues and improve conditions for workers.

Supplier Participation:
Many of our key suppliers have been working together with us for twenty and thirty years plus. These long-term supplier relationships are
crucial to ensure year on year improvements for the workers. Building long term, open and honest relations with our suppliers has allowed
us to be well informed and work with them to instigate positive change. This has allowed us greater access to workers for interviews and
training, allowing us to better understand their situation and priorities. It is crucial that suppliers are fully on board, with regards to treating
the workers with respect and encouraging them to exercise their right to have the freedom, to choose where they work. Following on from

the success of the multi stake-holder collaboration in Rajasthan and working in conjunction with our Indian partner supplier, NNG Group, we
have seen many signi cant ethical improvements at tier one factory levels in India. We found potential salient issues present here, based
around discrimination of contract workers, no recording of contract worker hours, lack of safety gear distribution and uptake as well as poor
HR documentation such as employment contracts and payment records. Some of the “step by step” improvements now in place, include
new shaded garden areas for breaks and meal times. Safer working areas with more safety gear distribution to both permanent and
contract workers. New HR systems including employment contracts and payments direct to bank accounts. H&S meetings and training.
Worker grievance committee. Contract workers hours now recorded. This further increases the ethical transparency of our Indian
production.

CED Business Ethical Principles:
Responsible business conduct and respect for human rights are at the heart of our operations. When identifying future business
opportunities, we do so in partnership with others that are equally committed to respecting labour standards and advancing human rights.
We strive for greater visibility and transparency within our company and communicate externally about the value of corporate responsibility.
We offer sustainable work to our suppliers and encourage economic growth. Ensuring equal wages with no discrimination. Child labour and
Modern Day Slavery are completely unacceptable and we will strive to eradicate these practices at every juncture. We champion labour
rights and promote a safe working environment.

CED Business Ethical Process and Due Diligence:
Suppliers must sign up and agree to our Supplier Code of Ethical conduct. They must also sign our Ethical Business Contract. Supplier site
must be fully mapped along with related quarry sources. Due diligence must be established for the relevant sector and an understanding of
cultural and country-wide issues established. There then follows a time-bound process of questionnaires, site inspections, audits and
continuous monitoring to ensure that no Modern Day Slavery is present in the factories that make our nished products. Our general method
for information gathering and initial breach targeting and resolving takes the following shape: Formalise CED policy with regards to Modern
Day Slavery. Ask ethical questions at time of rst contact. Inspect site to look for any areas where issues might suggest a possibility of
some kind of involuntary work or poor practice in this area. Discuss with factory management and get worker input. Conduct audit to
establish any gaps in Base Code compliance, discuss gaps and work with supplier to resolve. We have not uncovered any Modern Day
Slavery within our supply chain. However we remain vigilant and continue to implement small ethical “step by step” improvements to
strengthen the workers position. These methods outline our business processes, built into our systems of supplier approval under our ISO
9001 – 2015 quality program. We help to encourage good practice at production sites which limits or eradicates the requirement for slave
labour. Such as making sure the workers earn a living wage and all workers are given formal employment contracts. Over time SMETA
audits are necessary at all factories we regularly use when purchasing from our over-seas supply-chain. These audits are assessed against
the ETI Base Code and local laws. As the relationship develops we go beyond audit and capacity build with our supplier. This currently
includes investment in training, nancing H&S gear, supplying ethical tools and systems guidance.

Ethical Communication:
At all times we strive to keep ethical trade and the Ethical Base Code principles at the forefront of our business strategy. The more visible
and vocal we are about Modern Day Slavery will encourage others to support our stance and prioritise systems to avoid. We keep the topic
of Modern Day Slavery visible in meetings and on social media. We systematically remind suppliers of their responsibilities to the workers
they employ. We regularly discuss the topic with suppliers and encourage them to think more about how they can improve the environment
and situation for their workers.

Current work and strategy:
Workers priority is key to how we are developing our strategy and ensuring Modern Day Slavery is not present in our supply-chain. We have
gained much better access to workers over the last few years: Workshops in India where priority worker issues have been discussed and
actioned; CED staff talking directly to workers in India and China; Tier one supplier organised worker discussions; with factory workers at the
factories they use for our orders. SMETA audits which include worker interviews. Surveys which include worker comments such as the
Independent Evaluation of ETI Sandstone Programme in Rajasthan. We will continue to develop ways of understanding workers situation
and concerns and adapt our process and strategy accordingly. Whilst we focus our resources in Asia, we also audit factories in Spain and
Portugal to ensure there is no forced labour in place there. This forms part of our Iberian complete compliance programme. Beyond this we
are vigilant here in the UK with regards to dealing with companies and people who provide services for us, such as maintenance and
cleaning.

Targets to increase the effectiveness of our strategy to tackling Modern Day Slavery:
● Reach further factories in China with worker interviews to monitor their situation.
● Increase our activities of working with our trading partners to help them ensure that there are no contracted employees on their sites who
are forced to work against their will.

● Review our inspection and audit programmes to monitor if they are effective and calculating what else we can do to support our “zero
tolerance” approach to Modern Day Slavery.
● Ensure our supplier contracts fully cover our criteria and demands with regards to employment of workers.
● Ask how we can be more effective in collaborating with both customers and suppliers to support our approach to Modern Day Slavery.
● Increase transparency and visibility further down through our supply-chain.
● Seek further collaborative ethical partnerships with other stakeholders in the areas our goods are produced.

Action Plans for 2020

Worker Welfare and Safety is
at the heart of our business
It is Arco’s Policy to protect all workers from modern slavery and human
trafficking and promote Health, Safety and Welfare in our supply chain.
Hello,
At Arco we are committed to ensuring that acts of Modern Day Slavery do not
enter our business or our supply chain; we have a clear policy where we will
not support or deal with any business that is knowingly involved in modern
day slavery. We continue to build on our commitment to responsible sourcing
through collaboration with suppliers and investment in training and resources,
both here in the UK and in our China sourcing office.
We first published our statement back in 2016 and this update recognises
the progress that we have made over the last year, and reinforces our
commitments and responsibilities. We continue not only to demonstrate our
intent through the way we work, but also through sharing our learnings and
initiatives with a wider audience.

Our key areas of activity in 2019 were:
• We successfully completed a second audit of our National Distribution Centre to replicate those conducted at our
high-risk factories and enable a direct comparison between sites.
• We assessed approximately two thirds of vendors suppling goods not for re-sale to Arco, in addition to our activities
assessing our goods for sale supply chain.
• We were audited against the Labour Standards Assurance System (LSAS) by SGS, a global inspection company,
achieving Level 4, the highest available rating, against all 15 areas.
The statement concludes with an overview of the actions which make up our 2020 roadmap.
We’re making good progress and recognise that there is still much to be done. We want to assure our customers that
we take this issue very seriously and are committed to improving our robust processes even further. We shall continue to
report in an open and transparent way about our progress.

How We Manage The
Risk of Modern Slavery
Policies in relation to slavery
and human trafficking.
The Arco Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy and the Arco
Ethical Guide for Vendors (www.arco.co.uk/startyours)
These documents have been prepared in order to give guidance and instruction
on the minimum and recommended standards acceptable to Arco in the
manufacture of their products or procured services globally. Vendors are expected
to comply with national and other applicable law and, where the provisions of
law and the contents of this document address the same subject, to apply that
provision which affords the greater protection.

Ethical Guide
for Vendors
Incorporating the Principles
of the ETI Base Code
January 2019

Human Resource policies, including our Recruitment and Selection Policy, Whistle
Blowing Policy and Right to Work Policy address modern slavery and human
trafficking, providing both guidance for our recruitment teams and employees.
The Arco Ethical Compliance Requirements
The Arco Ethical Compliance Requirements for Vendor Approval procedure clearly
describes the process all stakeholders must complete for the Arco Ethical Team
to approve a factory.
Arco is committed to ongoing and continual improvement, training and capacity
building in the area of ethical trade, with measurable targets set annually as part
of its broader performance review and as a fundamental part of its commitment to
ETI membership.

Risk assessment and mitigation
All vendors must agree to the
principles of the Arco Ethical Guide
for Vendors in all new contracts.
In line with the ETI Human Rights
and Due Diligence Framework, Arco
adopt several methods to assess
and manage risk throughout our
operations.
Risk categorisation primarily focuses
on risk to vulnerable workers and
considers country, region and
industry using information published
by global NGOs. Our priority is to
those workers in high risk situations

5

www.arco.co.uk

where we can make the biggest
positive difference to their welfare.
High risk vendors must accommodate
a social compliance audit and resolve
improvement areas to an agreed
timeframe. This applies to Tier One
sites and beyond when necessary.
Vendors are encouraged to establish
and improve their own processes and
assess risks within their supply chain.
Medium and low risk vendors
must submit copies of own audits
or complete a Self Assessment
Questionnaire.

www.arcosafety.ie

On-site health and safety training is
conducted at high risk sites, primarily
in China. We plan to extend the reach
of the training to more countries.
During 2018, specialised training was
provided to Arco colleagues deemed
most at risk demographically. This
received excellent feedback and
refresher training is planned for 2020.

Salient risks
During early 2019, we became aware
of potential risks of modern slavery
within the Malaysian disposable
glove market. We collaborated
closely with our own label suppliers
to understand the risks. Our suppliers
have shared in detail the mitigating
activities they have implemented
throughout their organisation and
with their labour providers. Arco and
our suppliers have joined the ETI’s
Access to Remedy Programme to
help improve the working conditions
throughout the region. Our Head
of Ethics and Sustainability visited
our suppliers during October 2019
to witness first-hand the mitigating
activities, including production
safety improvements and the quality
of dormitories.
Gender inequality throughout
international supply chains is a
known risk, and can directly impact
both the human and labour rights of
workers and their families. Following
on from a project conducted by other
ETI members, we have started to
investigate the potential for similar
issues within our supply chains.

Due diligence
As part of our existing due
diligence processes, regular
assessments of new and existing
factories are conducted. Several
methods are employed to
conduct due diligence, with most
resource given to high
risk supply chains.
Our quality control teams use
time spent at the factory to
observe changes in both the
demographics and culture and
report back when necessary.
Throughout 2019, and in line
with industry guidance to reduce
the reliance on auditing, our
procurement team used their
time during factory visits to
identify signs of Modern Slavery
and exploitation and consult
with the ethical team on their
observations.
High risk vendors, including
those high spend and business
critical vendors to Arco continue

to receive regular audits. The
frequency of the audits reduces
as trust develops between our
organisations.
High risk vendors with a
vulnerable workforce such as
low-paid or high proportion of
migrant workforce are given
additional focus to ensure good
practice is followed.

Independent auditing

In July 2018, Arco invited Hope for Justice, a charity specialising
in Modern Slavery, to conduct a risk assessment at our National
Distribution Centre in Hull.
The scope included our own operations and our Labour Agency provider. The
experience was hugely positive and confirmed our operations to be low risk.
Hope For Justice proposed several recommendations for improvement which
are to be implemented during this financial year. The main risk to our business
being the process to transfer an agency worker to permanent Arco employment.
Hope for Justice are a registered charity whose vision is ‘to live in a world free
from slavery.’ They exist to bring an end to modern slavery by
• preventing exploitation
• restoring lives

• rescuing victims
• reforming society

Intertek Group plc
Intertek Group plc is a multinational
assurance, inspection, product
testing and certification company.
Arco commission Intertek
to undertake independent
assessments of some of the
overseas factories that we use.
They help us to ensure that our
products meet quality and safety
standards and ensure social
accountability standards for the
individual sites.

Training, Collaboration and
Thought Leadership
Training and capacity
building
Arco are committed to continuous
improvement through training. Arco
colleagues are provided with Ethical
Trade and Modern Slavery training
relevant to their roles.
Forms of training include: internal
and external classroom, on-line
learning and development, one-to-one
coaching and conferences hosted by
our ethical and sustainability partners.
Arco are an active member of the
Ethical Trade Initiative (ETI) Modern
Slavery Working Group.
Until now, refresher training for staff
has been limited to select groups
within the organisation. Our primary
labour provider ran a Modern Slavery
Awareness day during 2019, held
at our National Distribution Centre.
Action Sustainability, specialists in
sustainable business and supply chain
management, delivered training to all
procurement staff, highlighting their
role in tackling this issue.
Training will be extended to all staff
during 2020. Refresher guidelines for
staff on how to report modern slavery
have been prepared and will be
released during the next few months.
Our National Distribution Centre and
Arco Clothing Centre already have
this information available via posters,
but the information will be extended
Group wide.

Delivering Health and Safety training to two of our factories in China

Training provided for our vendors will
continue throughout 2020 and we
will continue to offer our vendors the
chance to attend training sessions
hosted by relevant providers.

Thought leadership
Arco are proud to take a leadership
approach to our stakeholders and
wider community. We firmly believe
sharing knowledge and experience
of ethical trade and modern
slavery raises awareness across all
communities and is a key step on the
path to its eradication.
On an ongoing basis we present
our approach to modern slavery
and ethical trade to organisations
including customers, their suppliers,
sustainability consortia and Health,
Safety and Environmental Groups
and have won several awards for
Responsible Sourcing.

Danny Hobson – Head of Ethics and Sustainability
In July 2019 Arco participated in a podcast in collaboration with BRE
and Sustain Worldwide.

Collaboration
The Co-Op Bright Future
Programme

Danny Hobson – Head of Ethics and Sustainability at the
Responsible & Ethical Leadership in Global Construction
Supply Chains Conference by BRE and Sustain Worldwide
(November 2019)
The conference in London was attended by key businesses in the
construction sector and leading experts in the area of Modern
Slavery. It sought to provide help and guidance on how to address
the challenges of data, transparency, traceability and disclosure.
Our Head of Ethics & Sustainability, Danny Hobson participated in
the panel discussion on transparency.

In April 2017 the Co-Op launched
The Bright Future programme, which
offered the opportunity of a paid work
placement and a job in their food
business to those who have been
rescued from modern slavery. Bright
Future is a new approach and is the
first time a major UK business has
offered work placements to survivors
of modern slavery.
In July 2018, Arco were honoured to
be invited to join the Co-op Bright
Future programme. We continue to
work closely with the Co-op and
several charities to offer the chance
of legal paid work to those rescued
from slavery.

Effectiveness of our
Policies and Processes
resale to Arco were assessed. The
assessment consisted of a review
of the modern slavery and human
trafficking statement, or completion
of modern slavery training or a selfassessment questionnaire. We will
continue this work during 2020 to
assist our suppliers.
Our Whistle Blowing Policy has been
amended to specifically focus attention
on Modern Slavery. The release of
the policy will be accompanied by
refresher training and published to all
permanent and agency staff.

Arco Ethical Team follow up audit report

The Arco Main Board and Audit
Committee receive reports detailing
the performance of our supply chain
and own business in relation to ethical
trade, modern slavery and human
trafficking.
The reports include performance
against agreed key performance
indicators (KPIs) across six measures
relating to the International Labour
Organization (ILO) Labour Standards.
Granularity includes country and
industry sector and by exception,
individual factories should issues
be identified. Our performance is
measured against global and
industry benchmarks conducted at
similar factories. All areas of concern
are investigated.
For specific high risk issues, further
investigation may be sanctioned,
including further factory visits or audits.
In extreme cases, and when all other
courses of action are considered, the
removal of a vendor from the approved
vendor list may
be required. During 2019, this action
was not required. However, we are
collaborating with a small number of
factories to help them to implement a
series of improvements.

Remedial actions were put in place
until permanent solutions could be

planned for release during 2020.
Within our previous statement, we
set some clear ambitions for 2019.
Happily, we completed many of those
ambitions. However, several remain
in progress, and a small number are
postponed due to new initiatives
taking priority.
The performance of our goods for

Arco continue to support the wider
community, to increase understanding
and develop programmes to mitigate
the risk of modern slavery.
Arco have invested significant funds
and time towards a five-year program
to help develop disadvantaged
children, through the Arco Scholarship
Foundation at Datian High School in
Fujian Province, China. It will benefit
over 180 local pupils, supporting them
in achieving their full potential.
In January 2019, SGS, a global
inspection company, audited Arco
against the Labour Standards
Assurance System (LSAS). LSAS
evaluates a business against 15
defined areas (some of which
include Policy, Roles &

Management) and measures its
maturity against each. Arco achieved
Level 4, the highest available rating,
against all 15 areas. A copy of the
report is available upon request.

INTRODUCTION
Our company values are “Work Hard, Play Hard and Be Kind” and
we aim to Be Kind in every aspect of our company life. As a
design-led British retailer, we strive to do business in a way that has integrity,
is ethical and doesn’t negatively impact others or the environment.
In 2015, the UK Government passed into law the Modern Slavery
Act; we welcome this piece of legislation and recognise we have
a responsibility to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking
throughout our organisation and in our supply chain.
Our third statement, published in June 2019, highlights the
progress we have made to identify and eradicate Modern Slavery
within our business over the previous financial year.
The statement was approved by the board of directors.

Oliver Tress- Founder & Managing Director,
Oliver Bonas Ltd, June 2019

BUSINESS & SUPPLY CHAIN OVERVIEW

OUR OWN BRAND PRODUCTS ARE BEING SOURCED FROM:

Oliver Bonas is an independent British lifestyle store, designing
our own take on fashion and homeware. Established in 1993 by
founder and Managing Director Oliver Tress, Oliver Bonas has
evolved from Olly bringing back interesting pieces from his travels
abroad, into an ever-expanding team of creative individuals.
Over two decades on, Oliver Bonas has evolved from curating
others’ designs to creating our own. Today, Olly is still at
OB, but Oliver Bonas now employs over 1,000 members
of staff. We are a growing privately owned independent
company, with 79 stores across London and the UK.
At Oliver Bonas, we are committed to sourcing the highest quality
products from many countries with diverse cultures and economies.
We value long-standing trusting relationships with our suppliers
and we commit to working in a transparent and open manner.
Our suppliers fall into four categories;

Oliver Bonas
own brand
Products

Other brand’s
Products

Other goods
we need as
a business
but don’t sell

Our top 5 sourcing countires continue to be

China, India, UK, Portugal and Turkey.
OUR APPROACH & GOVERNANCE

Services

Our continued focus has been on our own brand products.
For these products we are working much closer with
suppliers on the design, materials and selection of factories
as here is where we have the greatest level of control.

We recognise that this Act covers both our supply chain
and our own business operations so we have covered
our approach to both in the following pages.
Our ethical trade programme, which addresses Modern Slavery,
consults a number of departments within Oliver Bonas including
HR, Ethical Trade, Buying, Merchandising, Design and Quality.
The HR Director is responsible for managing the risks for our own
operations and our Ethical Trading Manager coordinates our efforts
to tackle modern slavery across our supply chain. The leadership
team have visibility of the ethical trade and modern slavery
strategy and are responsible for the sign off of this statement.

OUR OWN OPERATIONS

RECRUITMENT PROCESSES

At Oliver Bonas we have very high standards in regards to
how our employees are treated. We believe that everyone
should be paid a fair and decent wage, which reflects the
true cost living. We are confident that our current wage
rates achieve this in the absence of formal accreditation.

DUE DILIGENCE

We currently employ 1,050 permanent employees, but during
the busy Christmas period (2018) we employed a further
280 temporary employees across our Stores, Warehouse
and Web Fulfilment. We recognise temporary labour as an
area of increased risk especially when using recruitment
agencies and so this continues to be a focus area for us.

Our Recruitment team will carry out direct recruitment wherever
possible. There are a number of checks that are conducted as part
of the recruitment process and these include ensuring all perspective
employees have the correct right to work documents, checking and
making a copy of passport/ID and checking references from previous
employment. When paying wages, we will always pay direct to
bank accounts, never cash in hand, and ensure all employees have
an authentic National Insurance Number and home address.
When we do work with recruitment agencies we only partner
with trustworthy, preferred suppliers in which we have developed
long-standing relationships. All our recruitment agencies have
signed our Agency Commitment Agreement. This document
details the commitments we expect the agencies to agree
to in relation to their efforts to tackle modern slavery. The
commitments are detailed in our 2016 MSA statement.

POLICIES

TRAINING

For our direct operations, we have sought to create a policy
framework that both supports employees to identify and
remediate any possible cases of modern slavery. In our
previous statements, we shared details of our recruitment
policy and whistleblowing policy. Our policies are continuously
reviewed to make sure they continue to be relevant.

We have continued to train Oliver Bonas managers who
are responsible for recruiting, in line with the Stronger
Together framework. This includes all central HR personnel
who work in recruitment as well as store managers who
manage their own recruitment processes. During 2018,
we ran three workshops to train our store managers.

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN

DUE DILIGENCE

POLICY & RISK ASSESSMENT

MONITORING AND AUDITING

Our Supplier Code of Conduct (Code) details the minimum standards
we expect from any suppliers used to manufacture Oliver Bonas own
brand products. Our Code is based on the ETI Base Code covering the
conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and is an
internationally recognised code of labour practice. This code outlines
workers’ fundamental rights and freedoms including the elimination
of forced labour. We continually review this Code to ensure any new
advancements are updated and communicated to our suppliers.

For all our high-risk suppliers, we require that they complete an
ethical audit at least every two years by an approved auditor. Where
our suppliers have already had an ethical audit completed at the
request of another retailer we are happy to use this to avoid the
suppliers having to duplicate time and spend if it meets our minimum
requirements (reputable auditing company, approved framework,
covers all the clauses in our Code). We have partnered with Elevate
to encourage high standards of social auditing and enable suppliers
to access this at a discounted rate. These audits will include site
inspections, document reviews and interviews with workers in their
local language to determine if employment is freely chosen.

In addition to these standards, suppliers must comply with all
relevant local and national laws. If there is a conflict between
national law and the Code, the supplier must adhere to the
standard which provides the worker with the greatest protection.
We have communicated our requirement to our first-tier suppliers
that they ensure their own suppliers implement these standards as
we recognise the risk of Modern Slavery to be greater further down
the supply chains. As we engage deeper in our supply chain, we will
seek to learn more about the most effective ways to enable access
to remedy in addition to encouraging good grievance mechanisms.
We recognise the risk of modern slavery can appear anywhere
in the supply chain and we understand it may be more likely in
certain areas and scenarios. To address this, we have performed a
risk assessment across our business to determine where we should
be focussing our efforts. When assessing our suppliers we look
into a range of criteria including geographical location, materials
used, production process, our leverage with the supplier, visibility
of supply chain etc. This will give a rating for all our suppliers
of High, Medium or Low risk which determines the action and
priorities to be taken. We re-run this risk assessment twice a year.

Where issues are identified we will work with the supplier
to resolve the issue over an agreed timeframe providing as
much support and guidance as needed. We ultimately want to
improve the working conditions for those in our supply chains
rather than walk away from issues found. As a last resort, if
no progress is made over the agreed time period, we may
make the decision to seek alternative sources of supply.

SUB-CONTRACTING – METAL SUPPLY CHAINS IN MORADABAD, INDIA
We recognise undisclosed sub-contracting, where approved suppliers send
our products to be manufactured elsewhere, is a potential high-risk area
for worker exploitation due to the hidden nature of this practice. In 2018,
we have been investigating deeper into our supply chains to map subcontractors in our metal supply chains in Moradabad, India. We are now
designing a programme with other retailers, our suppliers and Traidcraft to
improve health and safety conditions, improve transparency on worker profile
and wages, and support access to social security entitlements.
We look forward to providing detail on this project in our 2019 statement.

COLLABORATION
We are a foundation stage member of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI)
which is a leading alliance of companies, trade unions and NGOs that
promotes respect for workers’ rights around the globe and we have just
submitted our application to become a full member of ETI. We are an active
member, working closely with other members to work in partnership on
projects aimed at tackling key ethical trade issues and high-risk areas. We
are excited to be a member of the ETI’s Modern Slavery working group. This
initiative works to tackle the following themes: remedy and compensation;
vulnerable workers; recruitment; and data/information beyond audits.
We are also members of Sedex, which is a collaborative platform for sharing
responsible sourcing data on supply chains. We joined with the aim to reduce
the administrative burden on our suppliers and after some initial research
found Sedex was the most commonly used platform within our supply base.
The system allows us to track any ethical audits our suppliers have already
obtained and gives further visibility in factory and workforce details.

TRAINING
We run an Ethical Trading training programme for employees.
All current employees will read our Introduction to Ethical Trade,
which will also be included in new employee induction process.
More specific training for both employees and suppliers was our
focus for 2018. We have detailed three examples of this below:

Employee Training – Responsible Purchasing Practices
The buying & merchandising team recently received a targeted
training session relating to ethical purchasing practices. We have
always valued long-term relationships with suppliers and are
pleased that a number of our original suppliers have developed
and grown with us over the last 20+ years. However, we are
aware that certain types of purchasing practices can increase the
risk of Modern Slavery (such as sudden changes of workload)
so we developed this course alongside the Ethical Trading
Initiative to ensure that buyers understand their impacts and
responsibilities with suppliers and how to reduce this risk.
“Responsible purchasing means purchasing in a way that
enables positive change at the supplier level, so that every part
of the supply chain benefits. It requires a trusting, direct and
honest relationship where both parties are able to negotiate
and share risks equally, and a purchaser who is committed to
supporting human rights within the supply base.” Traidcraft
The training for the buying team focused on how they
can create positive change in their supply chains by:

Sharing
responsibility
and risk.

Building a deeper
understanding of
production.

Forging a
constructive,
ongoing dialogue
with suppliers.

Making labour
standards and other
ethical criteria a
core part of buying
negotiations.

SUPPLIER TRAINING - CHINA
‘Prevention of involuntary work by scaling up awareness
modern slavery and recruitment practices in Chinese
supply chains through new digital technology’
In order to work towards tackling involuntary work, we partnered
with ETI and QuizRR to develop a pilot management training on
the issue of modern slavery. Companies have found that focusing
their efforts on awareness raising for both management and
workers is a more sustainable option than continuing the auditing
cycle. Despite the focus on the issue, there remains confusion as
to what modern slavery is, how to identify it, and what actions
and remediation steps to take once it has been identified.
The digital training tool combines short film clips followed
by quiz questions to ensure knowledge can be learned and
applied from the factory floor on up the supply chain. Aimed
at all levels of management, the initial pilot solution outlines
the preventive measures factories can take to avoid the serious
consequences of modern slavery for workers and for the business.
We chose one high-risk supplier in the Guangdong
region of China to pilot this training with. This way of
learning is great for factories as it is scalable, transparent
and has measurable results. We plan to roll this out to
other high-risk factories in China later this year.

MONITORING PROGRESS

At Oliver Bonas we are eager to continuously enhance and extend our ethical trading approach. A crucial part of that is ensuring
we are working with the relevant stakeholders to tackle the global issue of modern slavery. Our Modern Slavery processes will
continue to develop as we learn more from suppliers, other retailers, NGOs and multi-stakeholders initiatives such as the ETI.
In order to assess the effectiveness of the actions we are taking, progress will be measured using the following
key performance indicators (KPIs) and we will report on these in future Modern Slavery statements.

we advise them on ethical standards of
recruitment to mitigate risks of modern
slavery further down our supply chain.

Developed a training programme for
high risk suppliers / countries – this
year has focused on China and Turkey.

Extend the China digital training
to more of our suppliers.

There was insufficient evidence of
a process to conduct right to work
checks for temporary workers identified
through audit. The supplier worked
to remediate and raise awareness.

Continue to work with suppliers to
remediate/ tackle non compliance

At the next audit, it was confirmed that
the factory had established robust right
to work check for all temporary workers.

Our business
Rightmove.co.uk was established in 2000 and is the UK's largest property portal. Rightmove
is free to consumers and is where home buyers and renters turn to first to see virtually the
whole UK property market in one place.
Our customers are primarily estate agents, lettings agents and new homes developers
advertising properties for sale and to rent in the UK. Our principal sources of revenue are
the monthly subscription fees paid by our customers to advertise all their properties and
fees paid for additional advertising products and packages. Annual revenue for the financial
year ended 31 December 2017 was £243m.

Modern Slavery Statement 2018
This statement is our third response to the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, setting out the steps the
Group has taken during the financial year ending 31 December 2018 to remove slavery and human
trafficking from our business and supply chain.
The statement is made on behalf of Informa Plc and all applicable subsidiaries, including I.I.R.
Limited, Informa UK Limited, Informa Finance USA Limited, Informa Markets UK Limited, and
Informa Telecoms & Media Limited, where the activities form part of the supply chain or business of
Informa as a parent company. Please see our Annual Report for a full list of all Informa Plc’s
subsidiaries.
For questions or further information, contact Informa Plc.

Our Commitment
As a leading international events, intelligence and scholarly publishing Group, the integrity and
strength of the business relationships we develop are, I believe, fundamental to Informa’s
sustainable success. Modern slavery is the absolute opposite to this form of partnership: it should
have no part in any international business or its supply chains.
Through our modern slavery programme, and the broader programmes of work we undertake as a
responsible business, Informa is committed to ensuring that, as far as possible, we operate our
business and supply chains free from modern slavery in any of its forms.
This Modern Slavery Statement was approved by the Board of Directors at its Board meeting on 24
May 2019.

About Informa
Informa is a leading international events, intelligence and scholarly publishing Group. Through our
network of internationally respected brands, we connect specialists all over the world, helping
people to work smarter, make better informed decisions and expand and grow in thousands of
specialist markets.
The Group is organised into five Operating Divisions: Informa Markets, Informa Connect, Informa
Tech, Informa Intelligence and Taylor & Francis, with a sixth non-Operating Division, Global Support,
providing services that support the Operating Divisions.
In 2018, Informa was structured as four principal Divisions: Global Exhibitions, Academic Publishing,
Business Intelligence and Knowledge & Networking. The UBM business, which was acquired in June
2018 to create an enlarged Group, was reported as an additional Operating Division for the
remainder of that period.
Informa is listed on London Stock Exchange and a member of FTSE 100, with over 11,000 colleagues
working in more than 30 countries. The Group generated annual revenues of over £2.3bn in 2018
and has been a member of the FTSE100 since 2016.

Modern Slavery Programme
Delivery and Governance
Informa’s modern slavery programme is delivered by Group functions, including Compliance, Risk,
Legal, Sustainability, Health, Safety & Security and HR, and executed by operational teams in each of
the Divisions. The Head of Group Compliance and the Group General Counsel have oversight of the
design of the programme at the Executive Management Team level; Divisional Leadership has
oversight of the programme’s delivery.
The programme sits within our broader Human Rights programme, which is guided by the
International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on
Fundamental Principles and Rights to Work, and the work we do to support and promote
responsible business. We operate in compliance with local laws, are committed to respecting
internationally recognised human rights standards, and follow the United Nations Guiding Principles
on Business and Human Rights.

Sustainable Development Goals
Informa has developed several projects designed to enhance our direct and indirect contributions
to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Modern slavery and forced labour are specifically referenced in two of the SDGS: 5.2 and 8.7.

Supply Chain
Informa’s business partners are key to how we work; we aim to develop long-standing and mutually
supportive relationships with suppliers, contractors, agents and other partners who operate in an
ethical, lawful and socially responsible way, and share our belief in the value of responsible business.
The Group works with over 44,000 suppliers, ranging from authors and speakers at our events, to
multinational service and technology providers. Approximately 65% of our supply chain spend is on
contracts over £250,000.
Our suppliers are categorised as follows:

Venue construction
and décor

SME and partner
costs

Marketing, promotion
and advertising

Print and print
management

Property and office
related costs

Professional
services

Travel and
accommodation

IT

Staffing, inc. contingent
and contractors

Procurement and supplier management is led by a central Procurement team, under a Group Head
of Procurement and is delivered by centres of excellence within the Operating Divisions.

Codes and Policies
Informa’s codes of conduct and policies express our commitment on Modern Slavery and contain
details of how to access our whistleblowing services.
At the heart of our Group Compliance programme is our Code of Conduct and the associated
Business Partner Code of Conduct, which, together, set out how we expect our colleagues and
external business partners to act, and our position on modern slavery, child labour and other
related labour rights abuses. The Code of Conduct has been approved by senior management and
explicitly endorsed by the Group CEO.
Compliance with the Code of Conduct is mandatory for all colleagues and the document is available
in multiple languages, both internally and publicly on our corporate site.
The Business Partner Code of Conduct is included in new contracts and framework agreements, and

4
Information Classification: General

Informa PLC | Informa Modern Slavery Statement 2018

informa.com

a pilot by Informa Markets in 2019 will see all vendors participating in a tender process agreeing to
comply with it.
Our new Group-wide Human Rights Policy has been developed with the support of an external
expert on human rights and sustainable procurement following a Human Rights Risk Assessment.
The Policy will be published in 2019, alongside revised Code of Conduct and Business Partner Code
of Conduct, each of which will reflect the enlarged business and our commitment to our antimodern slavery programme.

Indices
Informa participates in several benchmarks and indices, including DJSI, FTSE4Good, Ethibel, WDI and
CEI, which include consideration and disclosure of our work to eliminate modern slavery and human
rights abuses within our business and supply chains.

Risk Assessment and Due Diligence
Risk Management at Informa
Informa aims to ensure that significant risks are identified and understood, managed appropriately,
and monitored and reported to the Group’s governance bodies. When risks are assessed, we
consider the potential financial and non-financial impacts and the likelihood of their occurrence.
Details of our risk management process and governance framework are provided in the Annual
Report.
To assess the risk of exposure to modern slavery in Informa’s internal operations and external
supply chain, the following key risk indicators are considered:
Nature of the business operations
Industry sector, including the type of product or service provided and nature of workforce
Geography, including location of operations, offices, venues, supply chain partners
Level and type of engagement with the vendor (larger or longer-term engagements provide us with
greater opportunity to influence, monitor and support)
• Local / national regulatory or legal compliance
•
•
•
•

A Group-level Human Rights Risk Assessment in 2018 included a review of our modern slavery risk
exposure in the context of broader labour rights risk. It identified, and confirmed, key areas of
potential risk which will assist the development of areas of focus for the Modern Slavery programme
in 2019.
The process included the development of specific risk assessment criteria for human rights-related
risks, which are aligned to our standard assessment framework but consider risks from the
perspective of the rights holders, as per the UNGPs, and include considerations of elements such as
possibility of remedy. It considered all elements of the value chain and core Group processes,
considering potential impacts on customers, colleagues, and participants in our extended supply
chain.

Information Classification: General

Informa PLC | Informa Modern Slavery Statement 2018

Operational Risk
Modern Slavery risk is also considered as part of broader operating risk assessments, including
Country Risk Assessments. These are used to identify various operational, security and reputational
risks for existing and prospective markets, where it is considered alongside broader human rights
threats and issues. Sources of data include the Global Slavery Index and the Freedom in the World
Report.
Informa’s Human Rights Risk Assessment also included operating territory analysis, including
country mapping, to identify the relative freedom of the territories in which Informa’s colleagues,
contractors, contributors and customers work and live.
We also referenced the 2018 Global Slavery Index to
determine Informa’s relative exposure in our
operating territories, to provide context not only for
our own operations, but local supply chains in these
locations.
According to the Index, 80% of colleagues are
located in jurisdictions assessed as having the lowest
prevalence of modern slavery, including the UK, US,
Netherlands, and Hong Kong; 2% of colleagues are
based in locations identified as being in areas with
higher prevalence, including Malaysia and Thailand.

Due Diligence
Due Diligence processes vary within Divisions and teams and the nature of the supply chains they
manage. The approach is risk-based, with more detailed due diligence carried out on tier one or
business-critical suppliers and those identified as higher risk, according to the relevant key risk
indicators.
Due diligence on business partners may include legal due diligence, adverse media checks,
customer references, completion of internal vendor management assessments (including requests
for policies, codes of conduct and similar evidence of commitment), as well as regular site visits and
face to face engagement.
Detailed due diligence is also carried out before engaging in joint ventures or acquisitions.

Areas of focus
The following page highlights areas of Informa’s value chain that have been identified as having
exposure to the risk of labour rights abuses. The predominance of each sector of the supplier
categories varies across Divisions, according to product offering.

Some of the suppliers we work with are located in areas assessed as having a higher prevalence of
modern slavery, including the Philippines, India and Malaysia.

Risk Mitigation Activity
Informa continues to put measures in place to mitigate and manage any risks represented by our
business and business partners, according to the risk profile of the engagement. These include:
• The use of specific anti-modern slavery and anti-child labour clauses in contracts, exhibitor manuals
and framework agreements
• Audits, including specific modern slavery checks as part of operational audits conducted by the Group
Internal Audit team, plus the tracking to completion of any identified corrective actions
• Communication and training
• Site and venue visits, including monitoring for presence of children on site during event construction
and take down; monitoring for use of forced labour
• Restrictions on the use of sub-contractors
• Internal processes, such as the payment of a Living Wage (Informa has been accredited as a Living
Wage employer since 2017)

Print Production: The Book Chain Project
Informa is one of 27 major book and journals publishing companies to be signatories to The Book
Chain Project, a collaborative project designed to support improved supply chains in the publishing
industry, with a focus on ethical and sustainable standards. Informa is primarily engaged in the
labour and environmental aspects of the project. We have maintained our supplier levels of
participation in 2018.
All suppliers who are registered on the Book Chain Project’s database have agreed to comply with
their Code of Conduct, which articulates standards of labour practice and environmental
performance based on internationally-recognised standards and codes, including the ILO
Conventions and the UN Declaration for Human Rights. The Code contains specific reference to
forced labour and human trafficking and recruitment practices, including a prohibition on the

7
Information Classification: General

Informa PLC | Informa Modern Slavery Statement 2018

payment of fees for recruitment, and to child labour, which includes details of remediation
requirements if child labour is found. These sections specifically reference as ILO Conventions 29
and 105, 138 and 182, and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, Article 32.
The Book Chain Project’s Labour & Environment Risk Assessment tool assists publishers to identify
countries at highest risk of poor labour and environmental practices; print suppliers deemed to be
higher risk who wish to appear on the Project’s database are required to provide an audit from a
third party such as ICTI, SMETA, SA 8000 or WCA. Suppliers that do not already have an ethical audit
can ask for a SMETA audit against the Book Chain Code of Conduct.

Paper and Timber
The global forestry industry is identified as having a significant risk of violations to human rights,
including the use of forced, indentured and child labour, especially where timber is sourced illegally
or unsustainably. Our Group-wide Human Rights Risk Assessment in 2018 confirmed this risk.
Informa’s Paper Sourcing Policy is owned by the Group Sustainability team and aims to address the
risk represented by this element of our supply chain. It focuses on three key impact areas, split by
the degree of control we have over them
• Paper and timber used in our offices and business
• Paper we specify for our printed products, books and marketing materials and signage
• Timber and paper we specify for use in our major events.
The policy target is to source 100% of paper from certified forest sources: our expressed preference
is for FSC certified products, which have as a cornerstone of their scheme the social impacts of
forestry. The FSC expressly states that it does not associate with organisations which violate any of
the ILO Core Conventions, including those related to forced labour. The FSC’s structures and
processes, including complaints mechanisms, engagement with labour unions and social NGOs and
extensive due diligence processes, help to provide further protections and facilitate the
identification and reporting of infringements of human rights in the forestry industry.
In 2018, across the enlarged Group, 94% of paper was certified as sustainably sourced, and a
further 3% was rated ‘responsibly’ sourced, although not certified. Responsible sourcing meets the
criteria set out in our Paper and Timber Policy, where other certifications are not available, or not
yet available.

2018: 10,240 tonnes
94% of paper certified as sustainably sourced;
97% responsibly sourced

Events and exhibitions
Informa recognises that any construction-related activity at our events and exhibitions may
introduce the risk of modern slavery, including the use of forced labour and, in certain jurisdictions,

child labour. We manage and mitigate this risk in various ways, including expressly forbidding the
use of forced or child labour in exhibitor manuals and contracts, onsite checks by operational and
security teams and ad-hoc monitoring by teams including Health & Safety and Internal Audit.
Venues are also clearly signed that children are not permitted onsite during build or breakdown,
and on- site colleagues will challenge any worker appearing to be under age.
During operational event reviews, the Internal Audit team assesses on site provisions to monitor
and manage this risk, including reviews of documentation and security, and observations carried out
during floor walks. Any issues or further clarification is detailed in corrective action plans and
tracked to completion.
ISEMS
The Group Sustainability team is developing a new ISEMS process (Informa Sustainable Event
Management Standard) to be rolled out to the enlarged Group in 2019. This framework will include
modern slavery related requirements, including participation in modern slavery e-learning for
operational teams and the use of the business partner code of conduct.
The ISEMS also aims to formalise and track the existing practice of many events, which is to engage
in a partnership with a not-for-profit or charity related to the purpose or industry focus of the event.
Certain events already support charities that seek to address modern slavery concerns relevant to
their industry, such as GoodWeave, a welfare standard for the rug industry, which is supported by
Decorex, Informa’s interior design event.

Training & Communication
Training
All colleagues and directly-engaged contractors are required to complete training on the Code of
Conduct when they join the company; the training references the content of the Code of Conduct
and includes specific sections on modern slavery, forced and child labour.
A revised Code of Conduct and new training will be rolled out to all colleagues in 2019 and this will
include information on modern slavery and related human rights issues.

Enhanced training
Informa provides more detailed e-learning, including guidance on how to identify signs of modern
slavery in a supply chain, to specific colleagues whose roles or responsibilities might provide an
opportunity to mitigate the risk of modern slavery. This training was extended to additional
colleagues in 2018 and has now been delivered to approximately 1,000 colleagues across 19
countries, including senior managers, events operations teams, facilities managers, health and
safety colleagues, HR and procurement team members.
Face to face training and engagement on modern slavery has also been provided to colleagues in
locations including the US and India and, as part of the Human Rights Risk Assessment, to senior
management team members across the Group’s key functions and Divisions. We continue to
monitor the training needs of our colleagues.

Colleague Voice
From the perspective of the modern slavery programme, Informa recognises the importance of
enabling anyone who finds themselves either a victim or at risk, to communicate safely. It is
important that colleagues and third parties who work with us feel they can speak freely, engage with
management at all levels, ask questions and raise concerns, whether this is about modern slavery,
forced labour, child labour or any other matter.

Reporting a concern
All colleagues, business partners and their workforces can use our whistleblowing and breach
management structures to report concerns.
Freephone whistleblowing lines, hosted by third parties, let all colleagues, customers, business
partners and their workforces raise concerns securely and confidentially. These can be made
anonymously, where legal, in multiple languages, and Informa has a strict zero-tolerance policy
about retaliation against anyone making a report in good faith.
Details of the service are provided in the Group’s policies and codes and on posters. The Business
Partner Code places a requirement on our business partners to communicate details of the service
to their teams.
Breaches of all aspects of the Code of Conduct and associated Group Policies are reported to the
Risk Committee and Board on a regular basis, and volumes of breaches and resolution times are
tracked.
In 2018, there were no reported concerns about modern slavery or other human rights related
issues via the whistleblowing service. One report was made by an event team to a Divisional
Compliance team in December 2018, reporting that a former exhibitor was the subject of an article
in the UK press concerning its alleged use of forced labour. The organisation denies the accusations
and the issue is currently under formal investigation by the local authorities; the teams concerned
continue to monitor.

Enforcement and Response
All colleagues are required to comply with the Code of Conduct and any breaches may result in
disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. To date, no breaches of the Code of Conduct have
involved modern slavery and there were no related reports or concerns raised during 2018.
The Business Partner Code of Conduct includes provisions for audit: where adherence to Informa’s
stated principles are contractually enforceable, we reserve the right to terminate our relationship
with a business partner if issues of non-compliance with our policies are discovered and noncompliance is severe or repeated.
We recognise that it is not always in the best interests of those being abused that contracts with
organisations engaged in modern slavery are simply terminated, and that it can be more
constructive to work with such organisations to address and resolve the issues, where this is
possible.

Modern Slavery Act Statement | Billabong

Modern Slavery Act Statement
This statement sets out Boardriders UK’s (as defined below) ongoing commitment as a responsible business to ensure
that modern slavery and human trafficking is eradicated, in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

Introduction
The Boardriders Group is a retail sporting goods business and one of the world's largest manufacturers of surf wear
and other board-sport related products. The Boardriders Group designs, develops and distributes a large range of
branded clothing, footwear, accessories and other products under the Quiksilver, Roxy, DC Shoes, Billabong,
Element, RVCA, and Von Zipper brands whose images and names are closely associated with boardriding sports and
lifestyle.

The Boardriders Group has over 7,000 employees worldwide and operates in 90 countries. The global business is
managed from three main regions: the ""Americas"" region managed from our group headquarters by the US parent
company Boardriders Inc.; the ""Europe, Middle East, Africa"" (EMEA) region managed by the French subsidiary NA
PALI SAS; and the ""Asia-Pacific"" (APAC) region managed by the Australian subsidiary UG Manufacturing Co. Pty. Ltd.

Boardriders Group EMEA business is organised into over 30 different corporate entities in 18 countries, including the
United Kingdom. The Boardriders Group UK subsidiary of NA PALI SAS is LANAI Ltd., which is located in London and
operates our commercial activity in the UK, including e-commerce (LANAI Ltd is hereafter referred to as “Boardriders
UK”).

Our supply chains
The Boardriders Group works with over 80 manufacturers in Asia, Europe and the Middle East, who supply our
warehouses in the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions with surf wear and other board-sport related products for sale
throughout over 90 countries.

We are conscious that imported products or services sourced from outside the UK or EC are potentially more at risk of
slavery or human trafficking issues. If products have to be sourced from such locations, we will look favourably on
suppliers who can demonstrate a commitment to human rights and fair working conditions.

Our policies on slavery and human trafficking
The Boardriders Group is committed to conducting business in an ethical manner and expects its manufacturing
partners to share this same commitment. Accordingly, Boardriders Group established a global ethical program in 2004
titled “QUEST” (Quiksilver Ethical Standards of Trade), to prevent abusive, exploitive, or illegal conditions in the
workplace and prevent human trafficking and slavery. QUEST reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with
integrity in all our business relationships. QUEST includes a Supplier Workplace Code of Conduct, and all agents,
vendors and factories are required to participate in the QUEST program as a condition of doing business with our
companies.

https://www.billabong.co.uk/customer-modern-slavery-act-statement.html

3/12/2021

Modern Slavery Act Statement | Billabong

Boardriders Group also has in place a robust whistleblowing procedure for the submission of complaints or concerns,
as well as a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, both designed to encourage and to protect anyone who wishes to
raise concerns about wrongdoing within our business.

Due diligence processes for slavery and human trafficking
Boardriders Group recruitment processes are transparent and reviewed regularly. We communicate directly with
candidates to discuss job opportunities and to confirm the details of any offer made. We have robust procedures in
place for the vetting of new employees and ensure that we are able to confirm their identities and that they are paid
directly into an appropriate, personal bank account.

If we discover that any of our employees have been complicit in human trafficking or modern slavery, we will take the
appropriate disciplinary action against them. Non-compliance with our QUEST standards, falling short of modern
slavery, can result in a Corrective Action Plan (CAP). Under CAP, our employees and contractors are expected to
follow a series of steps to correct their non-compliance in order for them to remain an active employee or contractor.
Otherwise, they face termination.

We have implemented a number of processes to ensure, as reasonably practicable, that our supply chains adhere to
our expectations in respect of their workforce. Annually, we evaluate all of our direct manufacturing suppliers to verify
that they are not at risk for violating antislavery and human trafficking laws. Our own internal QUEST team
spearheads that verification process, using an internally developed assessment tool. This tool helps us to categorize
suppliers using a grading matrix system aligned to each clause of Boardriders’ Supplier Workplace Code of Conduct.
This is a risk-profiling process in order to grade suppliers and alert management if a violation is detected, so that
immediate action can be taken including termination with the supplier to protect the supply chain. We also rely on
input from our independent factory auditors, particularly in jurisdictions where there is a higher risk of modern slavery,
to assess these risks and vulnerabilities.

All of our new suppliers need to be audited with acceptable audit results prior to cooperation with Boardriders Group.
We continue to monitor all of our supplier behaviour and compliance with QUEST, notably every year in high risk
countries (as defined by World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators), through an independent external contractor
who carries out unannounced audits and also by ongoing monitoring. This is the only way that suppliers can maintain
their “active” status with Boardriders Group. We have committed to work only with organisations who share our values
and who have pledged to assist in the eradication of slavery and human trafficking.

As with Employees and contractors, all suppliers are issued with a Corrective Action Plan following an audit. Our
QUEST team works with suppliers throughout the assessment process and factory management is educated and
assisted on any non-compliance issue encountered during an applicable audit. If appropriate, if following an audit we
do not see progress to resolving any non-compliance issues in the CAP, the supplier will face termination.

To ensure that our suppliers respect and enforce our QUEST standards, the commercial agreements governing our
contractual relationship stipulate that our suppliers must abide by our QUEST standards, or the contractual
relationship is subject to termination. More specifically, we ask our suppliers to agree to provide workers with a safe
and healthy work environment; allow workers freedom of association and collective bargaining; conduct business in
compliance with applicable environmental, labour, and employment laws; refrain from corrupt practices; and protect
against human trafficking and slavery. We also require our suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into our

https://www.billabong.co.uk/customer-modern-slavery-act-statement.html

2/3

3/12/2021

Modern Slavery Act Statement | Billabong

products comply with applicable laws, including those laws that relate to slavery and human trafficking in the country
or countries in which they do business.

We take a zero tolerance approach to human trafficking and modern slavery. We will not work or continue to work with
any organisation that we find has been knowingly involved in either human trafficking or modern slavery.

Training
As part of our efforts to ensure compliance with our QUEST standards and prevent abusive, exploitive, or illegal
conditions in the workplace, our QUEST department conducts ongoing internal employee and management training
regarding our code and human rights concerns, including human trafficking and slavery associated with our supply
chains. The training specifically covers mitigating risks of human trafficking and slavery within our company’s supply
chains of products, and is mandatory for those company employees and management who have direct responsibility
for supply chain management.

Our effectiveness in combating slavery and human
trafficking
At Boardriders UK and within the Boardriders Group (via a specific group affiliate that takes responsibility for modern
slavery matters), we shall take the responsibility for implementing this policy statement and its objectives and shall
provide adequate resources and investment to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place within the
organisation or within its supply chains.

We will continue to monitor this policy and review QUEST in relation to slavery and human trafficking. If we become
aware of any breaches of QUEST or any necessary update or additional to this policy, we will investigate and take
such steps as are necessary to ensure that the risk of further breaches occurring is minimised.

This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our slavery and
human trafficking statement for the financial year ending on October 31st, 2020

DAS UK HOLDINGS LIMITED
DAS LEGAL EXPENSES INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED
DAS LAW LIMITED
DAS SERVICES LIMITED

1: Statement from senior management
DAS UK Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries, DAS Legal Expenses Insurance Company Limited, DAS
Law Limited and DAS Services Limited (“DAS UK”) are committed to preventing acts of modern slavery
and human trafficking from occurring within its business and supply chain. DAS UK insists that the same
standards that it promotes in combatting modern slavery are similarly adopted and enforced by its suppliers
in order to adhere to the obligations and the intent of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (“the Act”).

2: Structure of the organisation
DAS UK operates in the legal insurance and legal services markets together with ancillary and
complimenting service streams. DAS UK is a subsidiary of ERGO Versicherungsgruppe AG which is in
turn a wholly owned subsidiary of the Munich Re Group.
DAS UK operates primarily in the UK, and employs 750 people with annual turnover in excess of £200m.
To find out more about our business, please click https://www.das.co.uk or https://www.daslaw.co.uk.
In order to deliver our services to business partners, clients and policy holders, we work with a range of
suppliers from professional service organisations to suppliers of consumables. Irrespective of the services
DAS UK receives from a supplier we insist that their obligations in respect of modern slavery and human
trafficking must be to the same high standards as our own.

3: Practices
As part of our commitment to combating modern slavery, we have implemented the following practices:


Notified and made staff aware of the importance of the Act;



Identified how modern slavery may manifest itself in the work environment;



Notified our suppliers of the importance of the Act as well as our stance on modern slavery and
communicated our expectation of adherence by them to our standards.

4: Due diligence and Supply Chain Strategy
As part of our efforts to monitor and reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring within our
supply chains, we have adopted due diligence procedures which include:
Implementing processes which require staff to procure goods and services through the approved supply
chain;
Reviewing and where possible consolidating supplier numbers to reduce the overall amount of suppliers
which assists in making the supply chain more manageable;
Where possible, assessing the origin of goods and services delivered through that supply chain specifically
around the geographic origin of goods to assess whether these are high risk areas;
Undertaking risk assessments of suppliers to identify indicators which may raise concerns about the use by
DAS UK of that organisation within the supply chain;
Carrying out appropriate levels of due diligence prior to entering into a new supplier relationship (i.e
reference checking organisations in order to share knowledge of other client of the supplier);
Carrying out supplier audits on an ongoing basis to monitor changes which inform the checks set out above
on an ongoing basis.
Our procedures are designed to:


Control the number of suppliers, such that they are assessed and managed so that slavery and forced
labour are not used in the supply chain;

2



Influence the behaviours of suppliers so that the objective of the Act is achieved;



Establish and assess areas of potential risk in our business and supply chains;



Monitor those risk areas in our business and supply chains;



Empower DAS UK to take positive and decisive action where breaches of the Act are identified or
suspected.

5: Risk and compliance
DAS UK regularly evaluates the nature and extent of its exposure to the risk of modern slavery occurring in
its supply chain as part of its supplier management procedure. Meetings take place on a regular basis,
depending on the supplier, the nature of the goods and services as well as any indicator that greater
regularity of review is necessary (i.e. where a supplier is sourcing from a location considered higher risk).
We do not consider that we operate in high risk sectors or locations because the majority of suppliers and
business partners provide either professional / insurance services or goods delivered from within the United
Kingdom. For the reasons set out in this document, DAS UK maintains a procurement process which
seeks to ensure that reputable organisations are used in our supply chain, contractually commits suppliers
to adhere to the standards DAS UK sets itself as well as affording DAS UK the right to audit and review the
supply chain.
If we find evidence of a failure to comply with our standards in respect of Modern Slavery or a breach of
legislation in this area we will immediately seek to terminate our relationship with the relevant supplier.
Where there are suspicions of a breach DAS will take positive action to investigate and either terminate
where proven, or work with the supplier to demonstrate with greater certainty that there is no such breach.

6: Training
We educate our staff to recognise the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and
supply chains. Through our training, employees particularly in parts of the business which manage our
supply chain, are encouraged to identify and report any potential breaches of the Act or suspicions of
slavery and human trafficking within the DAS UK supply chain.

7: Further actions and sign-off
Following our review of our actions this financial year to prevent slavery or human trafficking from occurring
in our business or supply chains, we intend to take the following further steps to tackle slavery and human
trafficking:


consolidate further the number of suppliers to make managing and assessing their actions more
manageable;



at the start of any new supply contract seek to impose contractual obligations to tackle modern slavery
and broad rights of termination for any such breach, as well as a right to audit their processes for
compliance by them and their supply chain;



undertake between 1 and 4 audits within the year in order to check our supply chain’s compliance, the
number will be dependent upon the nature of the goods or services supplied as well as the risk which
the outsourcing team believe should be attached to each supplier.

This statement is made in accordance with section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes
DAS UK’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year commencing 1 January 2020 and
ending 31 December 2020.

ABOUT US

MODERN SLAVERY
The Group has policies and procedures in place aimed at preventing Modern Slavery and encourages
employees and contractors to report any instances or suspected occurrences of Modern Slavery or Human
Trafficking.
MODERN SLAVERY ACT TRANSPARENCY STATEMENT 2019
KAZ MINERALS PLC
Introduction
KAZ Minerals PLC (‘KAZ Minerals’ or ‘the Group’) is committed to ensuring modern slavery plays no part in its business or supply chain and this
statement sets out the steps we have taken to ensure our business and supply chain are free of slavery and human trafficking. KAZ Minerals is one
of Kazakhstan's highest profile and fastest growing companies. With this economic strength comes a corporate responsibility to protect and
respect our employees and contractors, their families and the local environment. All employees are paid above the minimum wage and the living
wage in Kazakhstan, as defined by the Government of Kazakhstan. We respect the right to freedom of association and consult with our employees
and trade unions about changes to our business and employment conditions.

Our business, structure and supply chain
KAZ Minerals is a high growth copper company focused on large scale, low cost, open pit mining in Kazakhstan, Russia and Kyrgyzstan. It operates
the Aktogay and Bozshakol open pit copper mines in the East Region and Pavlodar region of Kazakhstan, three underground mines and associated
concentrators in the East Region of Kazakhstan and the Bozymchak copper-gold mine in Kyrgyzstan. In 2019, total copper production was 311 kt
with by-products of 201 koz of gold, 3,382 koz of silver and 38 kt of zinc in concentrate. The Group acquired the Baimskaya project in the
Chukotka region of Russia in January 2019, one of the world’s most significant undeveloped copper assets, with the potential to become a large
scale, low cost, open pit copper mine. During 2019 the Group employed around 16,000 staff and there were approximately 11,000 contractors
working on its sites, principally in Kazakhstan. Further details of the KAZ Minerals business model can be found on pages 14 to 15 of the 2019
Annual Report and Accounts.
The Group’s supply chain includes contractors and suppliers providing skilled and unskilled labour, energy, transport, smelting and other services
and consumables and raw materials required for the mining, processing and sale of copper and its by-products. A key supplier to the Group
includes the Balkhash smelter in Kazakhstan where 109 kt of copper cathode, 76 koz of gold bar and 2,492 koz of silver bar were toll processed in
2019.
In 2019, approximately 450 separate contracting firms worked at the Group’s mining sites, providing a variety of specialised services with around
11,000 contractor-employed workers present on Group sites in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan and a small number in Russia, comprised of both local
and overseas workers.

National context
The latest Global Slavery Index which was published in 2018 by the Walk Free Foundation, ranks Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia at 21st, 22nd
and 11th respectively within the Europe and Central Asia region, with an estimated 0.4% in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and 0.6% in Russia, of the
population living in modern slavery. Ranked by the estimated prevalence of slavery at national level, Kazakhstan was 83, Kyrgyzstan 85 and Russia 64
out of 167 globally (with a ranking of 1 representing the highest estimated prevalence and 167 the lowest estimated prevalence of modern slavery).
In Kazakhstan the main sectors of concern, in particular in relation to living and working conditions for migrant workers, are the construction,
cotton and tobacco industries1 [#_ftn1] .

Our policies in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking

The Group has established policies and procedures aimed at identifying, preventing and mitigating the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking
and it encourages employees and contractors to report any suspected or actual breaches of the principles set out in the Group’s policies, either to
KAZ Minerals management or by using the anonymous ‘Speak Up’ system which has local telephone numbers in all our countries of operation.
The Group’s Code of Fair Employment sets out the standards it expects to be upheld in relation to its own employees and the employees of
suppliers or contractors to the Group. It prohibits any involvement in human trafficking of any form and includes clauses prohibiting any forced,
involuntary, bonded, indentured or child labour, the retention of passports or identification documents, the taking of deposits, restrictions on
freedom of movement and the charging of recruitment fees to workers. All employees of contractor companies must be provided with contracts
of employment setting out their rights and responsibilities, be paid above the legal minimum wage, be treated equally with working hours that
comply with legal limits and have access to grievance procedures. Harsh or inhumane treatment is strictly prohibited, and workers must be free to
terminate their contract of employment at any time and leave the workplace.
The Suppliers’ Charter sets out the Group’s expectations from its suppliers in relation to human rights, employee wellbeing, anti-bribery and
corruption, community relations and environmental responsibilities.
The objectives of the Group’s Human Rights Policy are to ensure respect for human rights for all, in every aspect of the Group’s operations, in the
communities in which it operates. We have adopted the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
The above mentioned Group policies can be viewed at the following links:

Code of Fair Employment (LINK [/media/3265/oct-17-kaz-minerals-code-of-fair-employment-eng.pdf] )
Suppliers’ Charter (LINK [/media/3268/oct-17-kaz-minerals-suppliers-charter-eng.pdf] )
Human Rights Policy (LINK [/media/5648/kaz-minerals-human-rights-policy.pdf] )
Speak Up Policy (LINK [/media/16550/05-speak-up-2019-eng.pdf] )

All suppliers are required to comply with the Group’s policies upon entering into a contract with the Group and to commit to upholding the
standards set out in the Suppliers’ Charter and the Code of Fair Employment. Any negative outcome from due diligence undertaken, any breaches
of the Suppliers’ Charter or Code of Fair Employment, or a refusal to confirm compliance with the policies, could result in the termination of the
Group’s contract with that supplier and/or the exclusion of the contractor from working with the Group in the future.

Due diligence processes in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chains
The Group conducts due diligence checks on new suppliers and contractors to obtain information on the compliance systems and processes they
have in place and to ensure that the Group works with business partners who meet its standards. The due diligence process requires suppliers to
explain their compliance programme or code of conduct, and to confirm whether they have anti-bribery and corruption policies in place and
whether they are aware of any modern slavery within their organisation and to provide details.

Risk assessment
During 2019 a further risk assessment of the Group’s major suppliers was conducted to identify those with a higher potential risk of modern
slavery, using information from a range of sources, including the Global Slavery Index and suppliers’ labour policies and supply chain management.
Suppliers identified as a possible modern slavery risk were subject to further enquiries regarding their policies and processes. Following the
assessment, none of the major suppliers were deemed to require additional due diligence.

Measuring effectiveness
Staff are expected to monitor suppliers and contractors to prevent instances of slavery and human trafficking in the Group’s supply chain and to
report any suspected breaches of the Group’s policies through the appropriate channels.
In 2019 the Group undertook an assessment of internal working practices amongst its own employees to manage the risk of slavery and human
trafficking occurring within its own operations. The assessment confirmed that conditions of modern slavery were not present amongst the
Group’s own employees. This assessment is repeated periodically.
The Group has an independently managed ‘Speak Up’ facility, which provides a confidential and secure means for our employees, contractors,
suppliers, business partners and other external stakeholders to report concerns. The facility allows complaints to be submitted anonymously. The
Group does not tolerate any form of retaliation against employees who raise concerns in good faith. Any complaints are thoroughly investigated
and findings are reported to the Audit Committee or Health, Safety and Sustainability Committee of the Board which meet regularly during the
year.
During 2019, the list of suppliers with staff working on KAZ Minerals’ sites was updated. In respect of suppliers with staff on site, the senior
managers at each of the Group’s operations and at the Artemyevsky and Aktogay expansion construction projects, confirmed that they had
assessed and monitored working conditions and had detected no indicators of modern slavery on KAZ Minerals’ sites. At the expansion
construction sites, senior managers also conducted short interviews with selected contractors’ staff on site regarding their working conditions.

Training for staff on modern slavery and human trafficking
The Group procurement team is qualified to understand the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking and there is a training programme
addressed specifically at individuals from procurement teams and managers involved in the supervision of contractors. The aim is to raise
awareness of the standards contained within the Code of Fair Employment and Suppliers’ Charter, in particular those relating to slavery and human

trafficking. During 2019 this training continued as part of the induction programme for new employees in relevant roles, with approximately 1,400
staff trained.
Additional training is given to new senior managers on the Group’s construction projects where there are higher numbers of contractor
construction workers, to ensure vigilance on those sites. Training is cascaded by managers throughout their teams.

Next steps
KAZ Minerals is committed to continuous improvement of controls throughout the organisation. In 2020 the Group will continue to train staff and
to assess and monitor the effectiveness of the actions it has taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking are not present within the Group or
its supply chain and will incorporate additional measures where appropriate. Due to the progression of our Russian project Baimskaya during 2020,
increased focus is being placed on the training and awareness of workers in Russia, especially in construction management at site and in
procurement.

This statement is made by Kennedys Law LLP (‘Kennedys’) under section 54 of
the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 for the financial year ending 30 April 2020.
According to the charity Anti-Slavery International at least 24.9 million people are thought to be in
trapped in forced labour worldwide. Of them, 16 million are exploited in the private sector, linked to
the supply chains of the international businesses supplying our goods and services. Slavery exists in
all stages of the supply chain, from the picking of raw materials, to the manufacturing of goods and
at later stages of shipping and delivery to consumers. In the UK in 2019 over 10,000 people were
identified as victims of slavery and referred to authorities but the actual figure is estimated to be far
higher.
Modern Slavery can include:
Slavery - Exercising powers of ownership over a person
Servitude - The obligation to provide services is imposed by the use of coercion
Forced or compulsory labour - Work or services are exacted from a person under the menace of any
penalty and for which the person has not offered themselves voluntarily
Human trafficking - Arranging or facilitating the travel of another person with a view to their
exploitation
THE FIRM AND STRUCTURE
Kennedys is a limited liability partnership registered in England and Wales with a registered number
OC353214 and registered at 25 Fenchurch Avenue, London, EC3M 5AD. We are a global law firm
with expertise in dispute resolution and advisory services, especially in defending insurance and
liability claims. We have 2150 people across 22 countries and operate from 39 offices and 20
associations or co-operations globally. In the last financial year our global turnover was £238m.
Further detail about the nature of our business can be found on the firm’s website.
A high proportion of the firm’s suppliers are professional advisers and experts who are engaged on
client matters and the remainder provide goods and services to the business including the firm’s
accountants, banks, brokers and insurers, furniture suppliers, office supply companies, office

cleaners, caterers, vending machine suppliers, electrical and building contractors, archive facilities,
phone providers, suppliers of IT equipment, software and licences, software developers, website
designers, couriers, travel advisers, recruitment agencies, trainers, seminar providers, publishers of
hard copy and digital materials, motor fleet providers, event managers and photographers.
UN GLOBAL COMPACT
In June 2020, Kennedys issued a letter of commitment to the United Nations, confirming that the
firm supports the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact on human rights, labour,
environment and anti-corruption and its intention to implement the principles. This support also
includes promotion of the Sustainable Development Goals, of which Goal 8 (Decent work and
economic growth) is particularly relevant to modern slavery.
DUE DILIGENCE
Kennedys is committed to preventing acts of modern slavery and human trafficking from occurring
within its business and supply chain.
Our efforts to monitor and reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring within our
supply chains involve (where possible) building long-standing relationships with suppliers and
contractors who understand and are clear about the expected behaviours to enable the firm to:
establish, monitor and assess areas of potential risk in our business and supply chains
reduce the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking occurring in our business and supply
chains
provide adequate protection for whistle-blowers.
We have introduced a supplier policy that clearly sets out the firm’s expectations about modern
slavery and other important compliance issues. These requirements are incorporated into every
supplier contract and over the course of the coming financial year we will be carrying out due
diligence audits on a risk-based approach to verify the extent of compliance by all key suppliers and
any potentially high risk suppliers. We expect over that period to be able to establish key
performance indicators relating to the percentage of key suppliers who complete the due diligence
audits, the percentage of audits that are fully compliant, the completion of training and the number
of notified incidents, which will form a benchmark going forwards.
We have assessed the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking to be low across the firm due to
the geographical location of our offices and the mainly advisory nature of our business.
POLICY
The firm’s policy is to:

a) maintain clear policies and procedures preventing exploitation and human trafficking, and
protecting our workforce and reputation
b) be clear about our recruitment policy
c) check our supply chains
d) lead by example by making appropriate checks on all employees, recruitment agencies and
suppliers to ensure we know who is working for us
e) ensure we have in place an open and transparent grievance process for all staff
f) seek to raise awareness so that our colleagues know what we are doing to promote their welfare
g) make a clear annual statement setting out the steps we have taken to ensure slavery and human
trafficking is not taking place in our supply chains and to demonstrate that we take our
responsibilities to our employees and our clients seriously
TRAINING
All employees and partners are required to read and comply with our Modern Slavery policy and have
the opportunity to undertake training, which helps employees and partners to understand the
implications of slavery, identifying risk factors and assists with implementing the policy effectively.
ONGOING COMMITMENT
Over the next 12 months we will:
carry out due diligence audits on a risk-based approach to verify the extent of compliance by all
key
suppliers and any potentially high risk suppliers.
establish key performance indicators relating to the percentage of key suppliers who complete
the
due diligence audits, the percentage of audits that are fully compliant, the completion of training
and the number of notified incidents, which will form a benchmark going forwards.
continually review our procurement procedures and processes to ensure that our obligations
under
the MSA Act 2015 are passed through to our supply chain.

2. DECLARACIÓN DE TRANSPARENCIA SOBRE TRÁFICO DE PERSONAS Y ESCLAVITUD MODERNA

Transparency Statement on
Human Trafficking and Modern
Slavery
(in compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the
""Act""))

1. ORGANISATION STRUCTURE AND SUPPLY
CHAINS

1.1 Pinsent Masons' corporate structure
1.1.1 Our business is about providing responsible legal and other professional
services to enable our clients to manage and address business risks. A
commitment to behaving responsibly is at our core and it extends to
everything we do, and to those with whom we interact.
1.1.2 We operate as a global business under Pinsent Masons International LLP
which is the governing body for those entities which trade under the Pinsent
Masons name and brand (""Pinsent Masons group""). The main trading entity
in the UK is Pinsent Masons LLP (head-quartered in London). The Pinsent
Masons group is regulated by the appropriate regulatory body in those
jurisdictions in which it operates. We have around 3,200 people working in
different jurisdictions. Details of our corporate structure and where we
operate can be found on our main website - Legal Notices.
1.1.3 Pinsent Masons International LLP, Pinsent Masons LLP and its subsidiary
Pinsent Masons Services Limited meet the criteria in section 54 of the Act
and are therefore required to prepare a slavery and human trafficking
statement. This Transparency Statement covers these entities.
1.1.4 The Pinsent Masons group has a global turnover of c£450 million.

1.2 Nature of supply chain
1.2.1 We refer to forced or bonded labour, including human trafficking and
modern slavery, collectively as ""forced labour"" in this Transparency
Statement. In this section we describe our supply chain and consider the
risks of forced labour.
1.2.2 We provide legal and other professional services on a global basis. The
supply chain that supports our business and provides the platform that
enables us to provide these services to clients is broad. It comprises a wide
range of suppliers, from small/medium enterprises (SMEs) to global
corporates.
1.2.3 To illustrate the breadth of our supply chain, it encompasses products
and services from IT hardware and software, knowledge management
services, office design, fit-out and maintenance, recruitment agents and
temporary staff provision, cleaning and catering services, through to
outsourced services such as document production.
1.2.4 The supply chain that supports the Pinsent Masons group is primarily
based in the UK, however, due to the range of products and services we
require and the location of offices in our global business products and

services are procured from jurisdictions where there is a higher risk of forced
labour such as: China, Dubai, Qatar and various jurisdictions in Africa.
1.2.5 The range of products/services in our supply chain and the wide range
of jurisdictions in which these are sourced mean that we consider our supply
chain to be our primary area of risk from a forced labour perspective.

1.3 Business operating model
1.3.1 We are committed to:
(a) ensuring that there is no forced labour in any part of the Pinsent Masons
group or within our supply chains; and
(b) implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls designed to
address the risk of forced labour.
We act ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships.
1.3.3 Procurement in the UK is largely controlled by our Central
Procurement and Contracts team (CPC) operating a centre lead model and
working with around 70 buyers spread across the various business functions.
Whilst many of the goods and services required by our offices outside the
UK are sourced centrally in the UK, procurement and contracting guidance is
provided by CPC for buyers outside the UK for local procurement and
support is provided when requested.
1.3.4 We partner with a number of organisations who help shape our
commitment to doing business responsibly by providing us with specialist
advice and support. This includes Stonewall, Business in the Community,
Working Families, Employers Network for Equality and Inclusion,
WEConnect and MSDUK.

2. ORGANISATIONAL POLICIES

2.1 Procurement Policy and Supplier Code of
Conduct
2.1.1 Our Procurement Policy, which is regularly updated, governs
procurement by the Pinsent Masons group and incorporates our approach to
forced labour. It is made available to all staff through our intranet. The
Procurement Policy and associated intranet guidance and templates set out
the processes that all staff are expected to follow to avoid the risk of forced
labour in our supply chain, as further described in sections 3 and 4.
2.1.2 We require key suppliers to commit to our Supplier Code of Conduct,
which is designed to identify and/or enable us to address issues of forced
labour (amongst other aspects of responsible business). Our Supplier Code
of Conduct emphasises the need for active monitoring and audit through
day to day management processes to ensure and maintain compliance with
the Supplier Code of Conduct.

2.2 Employment practices
2.2.1 With respect to global recruitment and employment of our own people
we have implemented a number of measures as part of our commitment to
ensuring there is no forced labour.
2.2.2 We operate a preferred supplier list in relation to the recruitment
agencies we work with and new suppliers are asked to commit to our
Supplier Code of Conduct.
2.2.3 We undertake background checks in relation to new starters to our
business relevant to the jurisdiction they will be working in.

2.2.4 Pinsent Masons is an accredited Living Wage Employer. This means
that all of our people in the UK, regardless of whether they are direct
employees or third-party contracted staff, receive a minimum hourly wage.
The Living Wage is an hourly rate set independently and updated annually
and it is calculated according to the real costs of living.

3. DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES

3.1 Evaluation of suppliers
3.1.1 A set of checkpoints are incorporated into our procurement process,
from initial sourcing (business case), through the request for
tender/proposal, and on to recommendation and contract approval, to
ensure that at each stage the risks are considered, appropriate information is
gathered and that supplier selection decisions are taken in the light of the
risk of forced labour.
3.1.2 We require key suppliers to complete our Responsible Business
Questionnaire and to commit to our Supplier Code of Conduct, which are
designed to identify and/or enable us to address issues of forced labour.
3.1.3 The processes we currently operate were established in 2015/16.
However, the Pinsent Masons group has grown since then with several new
office openings, increased supplier spend and a growing number of functions
and buyers for CPC to support. To keep pace with that growth, the buying
process and associated supplier due diligence need to evolve and we have
embarked on a project to make those processes simpler, safer, more
responsible and more efficient. The project is referred to as ""Buying Process
Evolution"" or ""BPE"". One of the outputs of the BPE project is expected to be
an initial on-line risk assessment that will be carried out at the outset of
procuring any goods and/or services which will include more effective and
robust processes to identify and address the risks of forced labour.
3.1.4 In connection with the BPE project, and to improve our forced labour
avoidance practices generally, we will be undertaking a forced labour risk
assessment across all our suppliers globally, with particular emphasis on
supplier location, Pinsent Masons' office location and the nature of the
supply. We expect the first phase of the project and the supplier risk
assessment to be completed in Financial Year 19/20.

3.2 On-going monitoring
3.2.1 We incorporate a standing agenda item on responsible business in our
quarterly and annual supplier reviews with our key suppliers. Those involved
in managing contracts, particularly the larger contracts in the UK relating to
high risk services eg cleaning and catering have a high level of awareness, as
a result of compulsory training and guidance provided by CPC, of the signs
of forced labour to look out for.
3.2.2 The BPE project referred to above will introduce a requirement and
processes to ensure that all contract renewals are risk assessed (including
for forced labour) before proceeding.
3.2.3 Once the process for undertaking the forced labour risk assessment
referred to in section 3.1.4 is established, we plan to undertake that
assessment on an annual basis.

4. RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT

4.1 Assessing risk through supplier due
diligence
4.1.1 We have established a system for assessing the risk of forced labour
associated with suppliers and/or potential suppliers. The system enables a
supplier risk rating to be produced based on various risk factors such as
country and service/product type. We recognise that particular types of
suppliers are likely to give rise to a higher risk of forced labour, in particular
those utilising lower-wage staff such as security, couriers, cleaning, etc., and
those utilising manufacturers in low-wage countries, such as IT hardware,
and have weighted those types of suppliers accordingly.
4.1.2 We also use various well established indices to quantify the risk
associated with certain countries. Where, through risk assessment, we
perceive a particular risk of forced labour, we will undertake enhanced due
diligence, asking additional questions during the procurement process
tailored to the specific risks and utilising the resources and influence
available to us to ensure the supplier meets acceptable standards.
4.1.3 Following completion of the BPE project we will introduce an on-line
initial assessment which all buyers must complete before purchasing any
goods and/or services from a supplier. The initial assessment will ask
questions about the nature and location of the required supply designed to
flag risks of forced labour early in the sourcing process, and enable enhanced
due diligence and mitigating action to be undertaken well before committing
to that supplier.

4.2 Contracts
We have incorporated provisions into our standard templates for supplier
contracts to require suppliers to manage and reduce the risk of forced
labour. The standard provisions require suppliers to: recognise a
commitment to removing forced labour and to take steps to avoid forced
labour in their business and supply chain, provide information to us in
relation to any instances of forced labour and to warrant to us that no
investigative or enforcement proceedings have taken place. We also retain
the ability to terminate contracts where the supplier has failed to deal
adequately with any such risks. We have a more stringent set of provisions
to use in cases where there is a high risk of forced labour.

5. KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

5.1 Our targets for measuring our performance in respect of our forced
labour processes and planned improvements and training are as follows:
5.1.2 100% of CPC team members and 90% of the wider buying community
to have undertaken advanced training on forced labour (as referred to in
section 6.2) by December 2019;
5.1.2 90% of all staff to have undertaken the forced labour training (as
referred to in section 6.1) by December 2019;
5.1.3 implement and launch the improved initial and secondary assessment
processes for addressing forced labour (as outputs of the BPE project) by
March 2020;
5.1.4 undertake updated forced labour risk assessment across all our supply
chain (with particular focus on high risk sectors) by December 2019 and take
steps to address (on an on-going basis) any forced labour risks identified by
May 2020;
5.1.5 establish annual supply chain forced labour risk assessment process by
December 2019;
5.1.6 ensure there are appropriate forced labour provisions in contracts with

key suppliers; and
5.1.7 record all decisions to reject suppliers on the basis of a high risk of
forced labour assessment.

6. TRAINING

6.1 Together with one of our suppliers of regulatory training services, we
have developed an on-line forced labour training course tailored to the
Pinsent Masons group. This training provides an introduction to the risks of
forced labour with specific reference to how those risks may manifest within
our supply chain and the policy and processes we have in place to avoid
those risks. The training is required to be undertaken by all Pinsent Masons
group staff globally and was rolled out in our financial year 2018/19.
6.2 In addition to the above training, we have developed a longer and more
detailed on-line forced labour training course to be undertaken by those
individuals within the firm who have responsibility for sourcing and
managing suppliers. That training course will be rolled out in our financial
year 2019/20.
6.3 We have appointed a Modern Slavery Compliance Officer (""MSCO"") for
the Pinsent Masons group. All forced labour queries in respect of our
business and our supply chain should be reported to the MSCO. This role
been communicated to all staff within the Pinsent Masons group by email
and inclusion in the training course.
6.4 Further briefings and guidance on forced labour risks will be provided by
CPC to buyers in connection with the launch of the new policies, tools and
processes that are the outputs of the BPE project referred to above. One
member of CPC now has the provision of training and guidance to our
buyers as 50% of her role, and that will include training and guidance on
forced labour.
This Statement is made pursuant to section 54 (1) of the Act and constitutes
Pinsent Masons' forced labour statement for its financial year ended 30 April
2019.
The Board of Pinsent Masons International LLP is responsible for
implementing this Statement and its objectives and providing adequate
resources, training and investment to ensure that forced labour is not taking
place within the Pinsent Masons group or within its supply chain.
This Statement will be reviewed at least annually and made available on our
website.

the risks are considered, appropriate information is gathered and that supplier selection decisions
are taken in the light of the risk of forced labour.
3.1.2 Our buying process and associated supplier due diligence have evolved signiﬁcantly and
have resulted in the recent launch of our Procurement Gateway which includes an initial on-line
risk assessment that is carried out at the outset of procuring any goods and/or services to identify
and address risks, including risk of forced labour. If the forced labour risk is ﬂagged, further due

diligence is undertaken and the outcome forms part of the
supplier evaluation process.
3.1.3 We have been undertaking a forced labour risk assessment across all our active suppliers
globally, with particular emphasis on supplier location, Pinsent Masons' ofﬁce location and the
nature of the supply. We will continue this project in Financial Year 20/21. This assessment is in
addition to the supplier due diligence undertaken in the Procurement Gateway in respect of new
suppliers and renewals.

3.2 On-going monitoring
3.2.1 We incorporate a standing agenda item on responsible business in our quarterly and annual
supplier reviews with our key suppliers. Those involved in managing contracts, particularly the
larger contracts in the UK relating to high risk services e.g. cleaning and catering have a high level
of awareness, as a result of compulsory training and guidance provided by CPC, of the signs of

before proceeding.
3.2.3 The forced labour risk assessment referred to in section 3.1.3 will be undertaken on a
biannual basis.

5.1.2 90% of all staff to have undertaken the forced labour training (as referred to in section 6.1)
by December 2021;
5.1.3 monitor on a monthly basis initial and secondary assessment processes for addressing forced
labour (as outputs of the Procurement Gateway);
5.1.4 undertake updated forced labour risk assessment across all our supply chain (with particular
focus on high risk sectors) by December 2020 and take steps to address (on an on-going basis)
any forced labour risks identiﬁed by May 2021;
5.1.5 ensure there are appropriate forced labour provisions in contracts with key suppliers; and
5.1.6 record all decisions to reject suppliers on the basis of a high risk of forced labour
assessment.

6. TRAINING
6.1 Together with one of our suppliers of regulatory training services, we have developed an online forced labour training course tailored to the Pinsent Masons group. This training provides an
introduction to the risks of forced labour with speciﬁc reference to how those risks may manifest
within our supply chain and the policy and processes we have in place to avoid those risks. The
training was rolled out to all Pinsent Masons group staff globally in 2019 with 90% completion.
Updated training will be rolled out in 2021.
6.2 We also developed a longer and more detailed on-line forced labour training course targeted
at those individuals within the ﬁrm who have responsibility for sourcing and managing suppliers.
That detailed training is in addition to the general training referred to above, as well as the
Procurement Policy (issued to all buyers), the guidance on the CPC intranet site and the

procedures signposted by the Procurement Gateway. The detailed training course was rolled out
in our ﬁnancial year 2019/20 with a 69% completion rate. Updated training will be rolled out in
2021. We will focus the advanced training on new starters and those in the target group who did
not complete the advanced training in the last ﬁnancial year.
6.3 We have an appointed Modern Slavery Compliance Ofﬁcer (""MSCO"") for the Pinsent Masons
group. All forced labour queries in respect of our business and our supply chain should be
reported to the MSCO. This role been communicated to all staff within the Pinsent Masons group
by email and inclusion in the training course.
6.4 Further brieﬁngs and guidance on forced labour risks will be provided by CPC to buyers in
connection with the Procurement Gateway. A member of CPC provides training and guidance to
our buyers as 50% of their role, including training and guidance on forced labour.

This Statement is made pursuant to section 54 (1) of the Act and constitutes Pinsent Masons'
forced labour statement for its ﬁnancial year ended 30 April 2020. Due to Coronavirus and
reduced staff capacity we have delayed publication of the Statement in accordance with the
Home Ofﬁce guidance.
The Board of Pinsent Masons International LLP is responsible for implementing this Statement
and its objectives and providing adequate resources, training and investment to ensure that
forced labour is not taking place within the Pinsent Masons group or within its supply chain.

Introduction
Modern slavery is a crime that affects an estimated 40 million people around the world, and includes
people trafficked from overseas as well as people within the UK.

Trafficking Statement' setting out the steps the firm has taken to ensure that slavery or human
trafficking has not taken place within its supply chain.
Sova Capital Ltd (the ""Firm"" or the ""Company"") is absolutely committed to combating the risk of
modern slavery or human trafficking within is supply chains or in any other part of its business. As
such, this statement sets out the Firm's actions to identify and combat all potential modern slavery
risks related to its business and to put in place steps that are aimed at ensuring that there is no slavery
or human trafficking in its own business and its supply chains. This statement relates to actions and
activities during the financial year 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018.

Whistleblowing policy
We encourage all our workers, customers and other business partners to report any concerns related
to the direct activities, or the supply chains of the Firm, including any circumstances that may give rise

To reduce the incidence and risk of financial crime, focus is placed on knowing our clients,
understanding their businesses and carrying out proportionate verification checks, and is covered in-
depth in the Client Due Diligence Policy, the Account Opening and Maintenance Procedures, the
Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) Policy, and the Sanctions Policy. In addition to these policies, other
policies of interest related to financial crime are the Market Abuse Policy, the Fraud Policy, the Anti-
Bribery & Corruption Policy and the sections on fraud found in the Firm's Compliance Manual.
Training
All our employees are required to complete specific annual Modern Slavery Training designed to
educate staff to recognise and report suspected examples of modern slavery or human trafficking.
Further, additional training is given as part of the mandatory Compliance induction given to every new
joiner within the first week of starting at Sova Capital.
We further require all staff within the Firm to complete training, linking to its culture and ethics, which
is reported ultimately to the Board through departmental KPIs.

The firm is risk averse and undertakes due diligence when considering taking on new suppliers, and
regularly reviews its existing suppliers. Although currently only focusing on anti-bribery and corruption
and tax facilitation, the Firm will look into refining the process further.

Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT
Statement for the Financial Year ending December 2019
This statement is made pursuant to the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (“the Act”) and comprises our slavery and human trafficking statement.

Introduction
Avison Young is committed to continually reviewing and improving our practices to combat slavery and human trafficking. Modern slavery is a crime and a gross violation of fundamental
human rights. It takes various forms, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person’s liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain.
We have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships and to implementing and
enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains.
We are also committed to ensuring there is transparency in our own business and in our approach to tackling modern slavery throughout our supply chains, consistent with our disclosure
obligations under the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
We expect the same high standards from all of our contractors, suppliers and other business partners.

Organisational Structure and Supply Chains
Avison Young is the world’s fastest-growing commercial real estate services firm headquartered in Toronto, Canada.
Avison Young is a collaborative, global firm owned and operated by its Principals. Founded in 1978, the company provides value-added, client-centric investment sales, leasing, advisory,
management, financing and mortgage placement services to owners and occupiers of office, retail, industrial, multi-family and hospitality properties.
We offer the country’s leading and most diverse real estate advisory service. With its in-depth understanding of the market, supported by a leading research capability, Avison Young
advises private businesses and the public sector on the whole real estate lifecycle - offering clients a service that spans the entire property lifecycle from strategy and planning, through to
delivery and management.
Avison Young (UK) Limited and subsidiary companies are headquartered in London and have 14 offices across the UK, employing approximately 1,600 staff.

Organisational Policies
As a responsible company, we strive to carry out business activities ethically and with integrity.
In relation to people management, the primary policies relating to ethical working are our code of conduct and supplier code of conduct. Anyone working for or on behalf of Avison Young
is expected to uphold the values of the company.
The key requirements of the codes in relation to people are:
-

Counter-acting illegal employment;

-

Respect for the fundamental human rights of employees; and

-

The ability of anyone in our supply chain, at any point, to flag concerns regarding malpractice.

Assessing and Managing Risk
Modern slavery and human trafficking comprises a number of activities that are contrary to legal or moral conduct. We have reviewed our supply chain and established that any risks that
could possibly arise would fall into two categories; Forced Labour, meaning work or service which people are forced to do against their will under threat of punishment; and debt bondage
is where people borrow money they cannot repay and are required to work to pay off the debt, losing control over the conditions of both their employment and the debt. With this in mind,
we have considered our supply chain and assessed the risks of finding modern slavery issues as being low, as we source from technical and professional service providers from within the
UK, and mainly from the professional services sector.
Where we do have some element of risk is with the lower skilled and paid end of services, particularly within cleaning and security service sectors. However, this is a very small part of our
overall business and generally outsourced to reputable organisations.

Due Diligence
We pay all employees and on-site contractors at least the National Living Wage as defined by the Living Wage Foundation, a process that is reviewed on an annual basis. We have a range of
policies, including our Grievance Policy and Whistle Blowing Policy, available to all employees to access and use in the unlikely event that this becomes necessary. All employees and new
starters are made aware of their rights and our obligations under the Act and the policies that relate to this.
For third and fourth party suppliers, we only wish to use companies who are reputable and demonstrate a commitment to our values in relation to ethical working practices.
To support effective assessment of our supply chain we have strengthened due diligence questions and requirements of our supplier vetting programme, to focus on fair employment and
ethical practices, supported by a supplier code of conduct that we expect all suppliers to sign up to and comply with at all times in the course of their business dealings with us.
The supplier code of conduct includes a commitment from the supplier to permitting and co-operating with any audit requirement that arises during the course of the relationship.

Training
Taking a risk based approach we provide awareness training to key personnel who are responsible for procurement of technical services within our property management and facilities
management areas of the business.
To ensure that the rest of our Principals, employees and workers understand the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, we provide them
with a copy of the Modern Slavery Policy and encourage them to report any concerns to their manager.

Management Commitment
Avison Young is committed to being a responsible business and this is demonstrated through our management team’s approach to all aspects of compliance and supporting a policy of
continually reviewing our supply chain to identify and resolve any concerns that are found or arise.

7278113,https://wikirate.org/~7278113,Walk Free Foundation+MSA training (revised),Sophos Group plc,2016,No,https://wikirate.org/~6970348,https://www.sophos.com/en-us/legal/modern-slavery-act-transparency-statement/modern-slavery-act-transparency-statement-2016.aspx,1,,"Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement 2016
This statement is made in accordance with the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the Act) as they apply to Sophos Limited, and
all entities in the Sophos Group plc global structure (Sophos, or the Group).
Sophos is committed to compliance with the provisions of the Act. As such, the Group has a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and
we are further committed to acting ethically, transparently and with integrity in all of our business dealings and relationships. The Group has
prioritised the implementation and ongoing enforcement of effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery, including any instance of
hidden labour exploitation, is not taking place anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains.

Business and supply-chain
Sophos is a leading global provider of cloud-enabled enduser and network security solutions, focussing primarily on selling to mid-market
organisations (100 – 5,000 employees) and the channel that serves them. The Group’s products are sold through our relationships with more
than 20,000 channel partners who deliver to more than 175,000 sales representatives and 65,000 sales engineers. Sophos has
approximately 3,000 employees and although headquartered in the UK, it has 40 offices and a number of threat assessment labs and
product development centres around the world, including in Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and North America.
The Group’s supply chain in this context consists of approximately 9,000 organisations made up of hardware manufacturers and suppliers,
logistic fulfilment centres responsible for the distribution of our products, procurement vendors and recruitment and employment agencies
from whom Sophos employees may be sourced (each a Supplier and together the Sophos Supply Chain). Sophos also has close working
relationships with works councils in a number of overseas jurisdictions representing the interests and rights of our employees.
We consider that the principal areas in which Sophos faces risks related to slavery, include:
a. the Sophos Supply Chain and outsourced activities and in particular those Suppliers located in overseas jurisdictions identified through
our human development risk index management tool as higher risk, in accordance with the principles set out by Transparency
International, the Global coalition against corruption;
b. recruitment in our own business, particularly recruitment through agencies; and
c. any Supplier that is identified through the Human Trafficking Risk index (the HTR Index). The HTR Index provides Sophos with insights
into where potential human trafficking may exist using external corporate databases with more than 250 million records and
incorporates data from the International Labor Affairs Bureau and the U.S. Department of State. The HTR Index creates an automated,
repeatable, closed-loop process to proactively monitor the Sophos Supply Chain for potential human trafficking violations.

Our policies
The Sophos Group plc board (the Board) acknowledges the Group’s role in ensuring slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in its
business or its supply chains. The development of our policy and operational response to the requirements of the Act have been a matter for
consideration at Board meetings.
The Sophos Group Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy (the Policy) has been developed in recognition of the Group’s new
responsibilities set out in the Act, and applies to the Sophos Supply Chain and to all persons working for us or on our behalf in any capacity,
including employees at all levels, directors, officers, agency workers, seconded workers, volunteers, interns, agents, contractors, external
consultants, third-party representatives and business partners.
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring the Policy complies with our legal and ethical obligations, and that all those under our
control comply with it. The Policy sits alongside the existing Sophos Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policy.
The Group’s existing structure of risk management provides the necessary framework to support the Group’s compliance with the
requirements of the Act, primarily through oversight from the Risk and Compliance Committee (the RCC).

The Policy was adopted by the Board in April 2016, and will shortly be rolled out to the Group’s employees and the Sophos Supply Chain on
a risk assessment basis, primarily focussing on relevant high-risk business functions such as Facilities, HR, Procurement and Supply Chain,
and high-risk Suppliers, identified via the means set out above. A breach of the Policy would result in disciplinary action, and potential
dismissal for an employee, and the likely termination of our relationship with a Supplier.
All those subject to the Policy are encouraged to raise concerns about any issue or suspicion of modern slavery in any parts of our business
or supply chains or those of any current or potential Suppliers, at the earliest possible stage. Sophos aim to encourage openness and will
support anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith under the Policy, even if they turn out to be mistaken. Further, the Group are
committed to ensuring no one suffers any detrimental treatment as a result of reporting in good faith their suspicion that modern slavery of
whatever form is or may be taking place in any part of our own business or in any of our supply chains. All notifications received, together
with the identity of the notifier, will be treated as confidential.

Assessment of risk
The Group’s preliminary assessment of risk in this context, and the subsequent potential therefore for exposure to instances of modern
slavery, has been based upon business function and geography, together with the principles set out by Transparency International, the Global
coalition against corruption and including all parties being assessed against the HTR Index. Sophos has undertaken this risk assessment
with input from external stakeholders. The Group’s conclusion has been that the potential for non-compliance with the Act should be
assessed as part of the Group’s risk management process.
The formal process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the Group is overseen by the RCC, in association with
the work performed by the Internal Audit and Risk Management function. The RCC provide the business with a framework for risk
management, upward reporting of significant risks and policies and procedures. The Group takes a two pronged approach to risk
identification: (i) a bottom-up approach at the business function level; and (ii) a top-down approach at the senior leadership team level. All
identified risks are assessed against a pre-defined scoring matrix and prioritised accordingly. Any risks identified in the bottom-up approach
deemed to be rated as higher risk are escalated in line with pre-defined escalation procedures for further evaluation.

Procedures
This statement has been published in accordance with, Section 54 of the Act, as it applies to Sophos Limited, a commercial organisation that
carries on business in the UK, supplying goods and services and having a total annual turnover of £36 million or more, and all entities in the
Sophos Group plc global structure. This statement sets out the steps that have been taken during the financial year to ensure that modern
slavery is not taking place in the Sophos Supply Chain and in any part of our own business. The statement has been signed by Nick Bray, a
Director of Sophos Limited and Chief Financial Officer and Executive Director of Sophos Group plc, and published on our website with a clear
link on the homepage.
Suppliers: we take one or more of the following actions in respect of each Supplier:
a. we ensure that we can account for each step of our hardware manufacturing processes and that we know who is providing the
hardware to us that we resell. This is done by using BOMcheck. BOMcheck is an industry-wide regulatory compliance tool which is
offered by ENVIRON, and identifies companies that are part of the Sophos extended supply chain that supply components for our
hardware products to our immediate Suppliers. Once identified these companies are then run through our human trafficking index

management tool. This provides the business with extended supply chain information and data sources, to support our modern slavery
controls;
b. we inform our Suppliers that we are not prepared to accept any form of exploitation in their business or any part of their supply chain by
publishing our policy and statement on our website;
c. we complete Live Monitoring on all companies in the Sophos Supply Chain, and any anti-bribery or modern slavery changes for a
specific Supplier will trigger an immediate review and business assessment / investigation;
d. our standard supply chain contract templates and contracts that we negotiate with high-risk Suppliers contain anti-slavery provisions
which prohibit Suppliers and their employees and sub-suppliers from engaging in modern slavery; and
e. we conduct regular risk assessments of our Sophos Supply Chain. In cases of high risk, we audit the Supplier and, as appropriate, we
require them to take specific measures to ensure that the risk of modern slavery is significantly reduced.
Recruitment: we take the following actions:
a. We always ensure all staff have a written contract of employment and that they have not had to pay any direct or indirect fees to obtain
work;
b. We always ensure staff are legally able to work in the country in which they are recruited;
c. We check the names and addresses of our staff (a number of people listing the same address may indicate high shared occupancy,
often a factor for those being exploited);
d. We provide information to all new recruits on their statutory rights including sick pay, holiday pay and any other benefits they may be
entitled to;
e. If, through our recruitment process, we suspect someone is being exploited, the HR department will follow our reporting procedures;
and
f. We conduct due diligence checks on any recruitment agency that we use to ensure that it is reputable and conducts appropriate checks
on all staff that they supply to us.

Actions and due diligence
Proportionate training will shortly be provided to existing Group employees and new joiners, prioritising the relevant high-risk business
functions. Training will be supplemented by a suite of internal communications and the existing online resource facility which is available to all
Group employees. Future refreshment will be provided, as appropriate.
ince November 2015, Sophos’s standard supply chain contracts have been updated to include modern slavery compliance provisions, and
similar provisions have been included in negotiated contracts with new high-risk Suppliers when first entering in to a business relationship
with the Group.
In respect of existing Suppliers identified as high-risk, the Group introduced updated compliance requirements and put in place contract
amendments. Such amendments brought the compliance requirements in line with those introduced for new Suppliers, outlined above. All
high-risk Suppliers identified entered in to such contract amendments during 2016 and have therefore committed to full anti-bribery and
modern slavery compliance, at the Group’s request.

Effectiveness and performance review
The Board was keen to understand whether at the time the Policy was adopted, the Group would be able to do so with adequate knowledge
of the current compliance status of its Sophos Supply Chain.
In order to gain this comfort, the Group has engaged an external compliance data provider on an ongoing basis, to audit the Sophos Supply
Chain. All new Suppliers are subject to screening as part of the Group’s existing due diligence processes. However, as a standalone
exercise, the existing Sophos Supply Chain population was screened for any recorded anti-bribery or modern slavery breaches, and/or
related reports in the media globally. The Board is pleased to confirm that no recorded anti-bribery or modern slavery breaches, and/or
related reports in the media globally were identified in respect of any Supplier.

However, the Group is committed to keeping the existing Sophos Supply Chain population under review. Together with our external
compliance data provider, the Group will monitor the performance of the Policy, together with the Sophos Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policy
and will maintain a watching brief on the compliance of all Suppliers through live monitoring tools. Any alert raised through this process will
be subject to an internal review and where appropriate, a business investigation of the Supplier identified.
In the event an instance of slavery is identified in a business in the Sophos Supply Chain, the Group will require that immediate remedial
action be taken, and provide appropriate support to that end. Should the Supplier ultimately fail to resolve the situation to the Group’s
satisfaction, their contract would be terminated.
The Board do not believe that the Group’s key performance indicators for the financial year ending, 31 March 2017 make the business or the
Sophos Supply Chain vulnerable to modern slavery. However, this will be kept under ongoing review, and reassessed each year.

Conclusion
The Group’s position and approach to managing our compliance with the Act continues to evolve. However, we are pleased with the
measures taken to date, and the processes now in place to ensure this will be kept under regular and effective review. The Board delegated
approval of this statement on its behalf to the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, on 8 November 2016.

Statement 2017
This statement is made in accordance with Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the Act) as
it applies to Sophos Limited, a commercial organisation that carries on business in the UK,
supplying goods and services and having a total annual turnover of £36 million or more, and all
entities in the Sophos Group plc global structure (together Sophos, or the Group). This statement
sets out the steps that have been taken during the financial year to 31 March 2017 to ensure that
modern slavery is not taking place in the Sophos Supply Chain and in any part of our own
business.
The statement has been signed by Nick Bray, a Director of Sophos Limited and Chief Financial
Officer and Executive Director of Sophos Group plc, and published on our
website www.sophos.com, with a clear link on the homepage.
During 2016, the Group adopted the Sophos Group Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy
(the Policy) and prioritised the establishment and implementation of effective systems and controls,
reflective of Sophos commitment to acting ethically, transparently and with integrity in all of our
business dealings and relationships.
During 2017, the Group has primarily focused on training, monitoring and the ongoing enforcement
of the Group’s systems and processes in order to maintain high standards and to continually
improve Sophos ability to effectively manage the risk of modern slavery, including any instance of
hidden labour exploitation, taking place anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply
chains.

Our structure and business model
Sophos is a leading global provider of cloud-enabled enduser and network security solutions,
offering organisations end-to-end protection against known and unknown IT threats through
products that are easy to install, configure, update and maintain. The Group’s products are sold
through our relationships with more than 30,000 channel partners who deliver to more than
300,000 sales representatives and 150,000 sales engineers. Sophos has approximately 3,000
employees and although headquartered in the UK, it has 52 offices and a number of threat
assessment labs and product development centres around the world, including in Asia Pacific,
Europe, the Middle East and North America.
Sophos saw significant growth in the number of channel partners and customers during the
financial year and our current approach remains effective. As the business continues to grow
however, we will continue to monitor our effectiveness, as discussed later in the statement and
make adjustments to our approach to ensure it remains proportionate.
The Group’s supply chain in this context consists of approximately 9,000 organisations made up of
hardware manufacturers and suppliers, logistic fulfilment centres responsible for the distribution of

our products, procurement vendors and recruitment and employment agencies from whom Sophos
employees may be sourced (each a Supplier and together the Sophos Supply Chain). Sophos
also has close working relationships with works councils in a number of overseas jurisdictions
representing the interests and rights of our employees.
We consider that the principal areas in which Sophos faces risks related to slavery, include:
a. the Sophos Supply Chain and outsourced activities and in particular those Suppliers located
in overseas jurisdictions identified through our human development risk index management
tool as higher risk, in accordance with the principles set out by Transparency International,
the Global coalition against corruption;
b. recruitment in our own business, particularly recruitment through agencies; and
c. any Supplier that is identified through the Human Trafficking Risk index (the HTR Index) an
assessment tool established by Transparency International, the Global coalition against
corruption. The HTR Index provides Sophos with insights into where potential human
trafficking may exist using external corporate databases with more than 250 million records
and incorporates data from the International Labor Affairs Bureau and the U.S. Department of
State. The HTR Index creates an automated, repeatable, closed-loop process to proactively
monitor the Sophos Supply Chain for potential human trafficking violations.

Our governance and policies
The Sophos Group plc Board (the Board) has overall responsibility for ensuring the Policy complies
with our legal and ethical obligations, and that all those under our control comply with it.
The Risk and Compliance Committee (the RCC), a sub-committee of the Board’s Audit and Risk
Committee provides oversight with regard to the implementation of the Policy and monitoring of
risks and issues raised through the Sophos Whistleblowing Policy. The Policy sits alongside the
existing Sophos Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policy and the Sophos Whistleblowing Policy, and is
available at https://investors.sophos.com
The Policy was rolled out to the Group’s employees and the Sophos Supply Chain during the year
on a risk assessed basis, primarily focussing on high-risk business functions such as Facilities, HR,
Procurement and Supply Chain, and high-risk Suppliers identified via the means set out above.
Any breach of the Policy would result in disciplinary action, and potential dismissal for an
employee, and the likely termination of our relationship with a Supplier.
The Policy recognises the Group’s responsibilities under the Act, and applies to the Sophos Supply
Chain and to all persons working for us or on our behalf in any capacity, including employees at all
levels, directors, officers, agency workers, seconded workers, volunteers, interns, agents,
contractors, external consultants, third-party representatives and business partners.

Whistleblowing

All those subject to the Policy are encouraged to raise concerns about any issue or suspicion of
modern slavery in any part of our business or supply chains or those of any current or potential
Suppliers, at the earliest possible stage. The Sophos Whistleblowing Policy is in place to enable
employees to confidentially report matters of concern directly to their line manager or their
designated HR manager. Where appropriate, such matters may be brought directly to the attention
of the Senior Independent Director and the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee, each of
whom are independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Group is committed to ensuring no one suffers any detrimental treatment as a result of
reporting in good faith their suspicion.

Ongoing assessment of risk
The potential for non-compliance with the Act is assessed as part of the Group’s risk management
process. Sophos undertakes this risk assessment with input from external advisers, Dechert LLP.
The assessment criteria applied include, business function and geography, together with the
principles set out by Transparency International. Each Supplier is also assessed against their HTR
Index, a further means of identifying where potential human trafficking may exist using external
corporate databases with more than 250 million records, as set out in more detail earlier in this
statement.
The formal process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the Group is
overseen by the RCC, in association with the work performed by the Internal Audit and Risk
Management function. The RCC provide the business with a framework for risk management,
upward reporting of significant risks and policies and procedures.
The Group takes a two pronged approach to risk identification: (i) a bottom-up approach at the
business function level; and (ii) a top-down approach at the senior leadership team level. All
identified risks are assessed against a pre-defined scoring matrix and prioritised accordingly. Any
risks identified in the bottom-up approach deemed to be rated as higher risk are escalated in line
with pre-defined escalation procedures for further evaluation.

Procedures
Suppliers: we take one or more of the following actions in respect of each Supplier:
a. we ensure that we can account for each step of our hardware manufacturing processes and
that we know who is providing the hardware to us that we resell. This is done by using
BOMcheck. BOMcheck is an industry-wide regulatory compliance tool which is offered by
ENVIRON, and identifies companies that are part of the Sophos extended supply chain that
supply components for our hardware products to our immediate Suppliers. Once identified,
these companies are then run through our human trafficking index management tool. This
provides the business with extended supply chain information and data sources, to support
our modern slavery controls;

b. we inform our Suppliers that we are not prepared to accept any form of exploitation in their
business or any part of their supply chain by publishing our policy and statement on our
website. All Suppliers make an annual Sophos Code of Conduct declaration. This declaration
includes the identification of all parties that supply products to our Supplier to ensure
extended supply chain information is known by Sophos and integrated into our management
control processes;
c. we complete Live Monitoring on all companies in the Sophos Supply Chain, and any anticorruption or modern slavery changes for a specific Supplier will trigger an immediate review
and business investigation, together with identifying specific risk indicators and categories;
d. our standard supply chain contract templates and contracts that we negotiate with high-risk
Suppliers contain anti-slavery provisions which prohibit Suppliers and their employees and
sub-suppliers from engaging in modern slavery; and
e. we conduct regular risk assessments of our Sophos Supply Chain. In cases of high-risk, we
audit the Supplier and, as appropriate, we require them to take specific measures to ensure
that the risk of modern slavery is significantly reduced.

Recruitment: we take the following actions:
a. we always ensure all staff have a written contract of employment and that they have not had
to pay any direct or indirect fees to obtain work;
b. we always ensure staff are legally able to work in the country in which they are recruited;
c. we check the names and addresses of our staff (a number of people listing the same address
may indicate high shared occupancy, often a factor for those being exploited);
d. we provide information to all new recruits on their statutory rights including sick pay, holiday
pay and any other benefits they may be entitled to;
e. if, through our recruitment process, we suspect someone is being exploited, the HR
department will follow our reporting procedures; and
f. we conduct due diligence checks on any recruitment agency that we use to ensure that it is
reputable and conducts appropriate checks on all staff that they supply to us.

Awareness
Mandatory training has been rolled out to all existing Group employees and new joiners alike.
Priority was given to the relevant high-risk business functions. Training was accompanied by a
suite of internal communications and an online resource facility which is available to all Group
employees. Refreshment of these materials will be ongoing.
Since November 2015, Sophos’ standard supply chain contracts have included modern slavery
compliance provisions, and similar provisions are included in negotiated contracts with new high-

risk Suppliers when first entering in to a business relationship with the Group. All existing high-risk
Suppliers have entered in to contract amendments and are therefore, committed to full anti-bribery
and modern slavery compliance.

Monitoring and performance review
Sophos engages an external compliance data provider on an ongoing basis, to audit the Sophos
Supply Chain and keep it under review. Together with our external compliance data provider, the
Group will monitor the performance of the Policy, together with the Sophos Anti-Corruption and
Bribery Policy and the Whistleblowing Policy, and will maintain a watching brief on the compliance
of all Suppliers through live monitoring tools. Any alert raised through this process will be subject
to an internal review and where appropriate, a business investigation of the Supplier identified.
During 2017, no material alerts have been raised by our external compliance data provider
concerning any Supplier, including recruitment agencies.
All new Suppliers are subject to screening as part of the Group’s existing due diligence processes.
In the event an instance of slavery is identified in a business in the Sophos Supply Chain, the
Group will require that immediate remedial action be taken, and provide appropriate support to that
end. Should the Supplier ultimately fail to resolve the situation to the Group’s satisfaction, their
contract would be terminated. During 2017, no instances of modern slavery were identified, and 25
cases were investigated. Following investigation, no further action was required in the Sophos
Supply Chain.
Sophos has introduced key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor how the Company manages
and communicates the Policy and the potential impacts as well as specific concerns regarding
modern slavery. These indicators were implemented in consultation with the RCC and the Internal
Audit and Risk Management and Legal functions internally, as well as Sophos external compliance
data provider.
Indicators used, include:
a. Understanding the Sophos Supply Chain
a. we can account for each step of our supply and distributor processes and we know who
is providing goods and services to us;
b. our level of communication and personal contact with the next link in our supply chain
and their understanding of, and compliance with, our expectations.
b. Code of Conduct and Statement of Compliance
a. number/percentage of suppliers and distributors who have signed our Code of Conduct;
b. number/percentage of suppliers and distributors who have provided a satisfactory
‘Statement of Compliance’ on their actions to prevent slavery and any concerns have
been satisfactorily and promptly resolved;
c. Assessment and screening

a. number/percentage of new and existing suppliers and distributors satisfactorily
screened using risk assessment tools and/or self-assessment questionnaires, including
risk scoring and categorization.
d. Reports on Concerns
a. number of reported concerns of slavery (including if there were none);
b. any material issues arising from implementation of the Policy were effectively escalated
when the need arose;
c. all concerns raised as a result of audits or allegations were promptly followed-up and
resolved;
d. how we responded to concerns raised or to issues found by screenings, assessments
or audits and how we worked with suppliers and distributors to implement corrective
action plans.
Performance against these indicators is covered in the quarterly reporting process to the
RCC and also the Audit and Risk Committee as part of the Internal Audit and Risk
Management reporting cycle.
As a business, we are focused on further expanding our KPIs as part of our continuous
improvement process, in order to ensure effective management control mechanisms.
The Board do not believe that the Group’s KPIs for the financial year ending, 31 March 2018
make the business or the Sophos Supply Chain vulnerable to modern slavery. However, this
will be kept under ongoing review, and reassessed each year.

Conclusion
The Group’s position and approach to managing our compliance with the Act continues to
evolve. However, we continue to be pleased with the measures taken to date, and the
processes in place to ensure this will be kept under regular and effective review, and our
performance will be measured.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Act. The Board delegated approval of
this statement on its behalf to the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, on 7 September
2017.

Modern Slavery Act Statement
Introduction
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Modern
Slavery Act”). It sets out the steps that we, CELF Advisors LLP (""CELF""), have taken to seek to ensure
that modern slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in our business and supply chains
during the most recently ended financial year.
Organisation’s Structure
CELF is a UK-based affiliate of The Carlyle Group (“Carlyle”), one of the largest and most diversified
multi-product global alternative asset management firms in the world, offering specialized investment
funds and other investment vehicles that invest across a range of industries, geographies, asset classes
and investment strategies. Carlyle operates its business through CELF and other Carlyle-affiliated
investment advisers. CELF’s principal place of business is in London and it is authorised and regulated
by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK. CELF provides collateral management services to
European structured credit funds and also provides sub-advisory services in respect of certain other
Carlyle-advised funds.
Supply Chain
As an investment advisory firm, we have relatively limited supply chains. Consequently, our
assessment of the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking is based on the nature of our industry
and the limited extent of our supply chains. In connection with our business activities, we engage
external parties to provide support services such as office cleaning and IT development suppliers. We
also outsource some ancillary functions relating to our business to professional service firms, such as
law firms and accountancy firms.
Measures to Address Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking
Global Measures
In connection with our affiliation with Carlyle, we are subject to a number of global measures designed
to address the social and governance risks related to Carlyle’s business as a global investment firm,
including, for example, the risk of suppliers or business partners engaging in illegal or improper
conduct. For example, such measures include the following policies and procedures:
• the Carlyle Code of Conduct, which provides Carlyle personnel with guidelines for proper
business conduct;
• the Carlyle Policy on Compliance with Anticorruption and Anti-Bribery Laws, which provides
Carlyle personnel with guidelines for compliance with applicable anticorruption laws; and

•

the Carlyle Whistleblower Policy, which outlines ways in which individuals can report illegal
or unethical behaviour.

Further, managing environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues has become integral
to how Carlyle invests and conducts its business. Among other things in support of these efforts, on

an annual basis, Carlyle prepares a Corporate Citizenship Report, which discusses the firm’s ESG
responsibilities and activities. A copy of this report can be accessed here.
CELF-Specific Measures
Further, we have put in place a Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy (the ""MSA Policy""),
which seeks to identify and manage modern slavery-related risks in our business and supply chains.
In adopting this policy, we seek to accomplish the below overarching objectives:
• Continuing to develop systems to (a) identify, assess and monitor potential higher risk areas
in our supply chains, (b) mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our
supply chains through enhanced contract term controls (as applicable and wherever possible),
(c) train our employees as to these risks and the need to manage them and (d) protect whistle
blowers.
• Where possible, building long-standing relationships with our key suppliers and ensuring that
expectations of business behaviour are clear and consistent.
Implementation
Our Legal & Compliance and Human Resources Teams will work together to implement the
objectives considered in this statement.
Effectiveness
We will continue to monitor our compliance with this statement and our policies, in the following
ways:
• training on modern slavery (see below);
• implementation of the MSA Policy;
• maintenance of systems for supply chain identification, including adding modern slavery
enquiries and controls to Carlyle’s vendor management and procurement policies; and
• ongoing review of existing and new supply chains.
Training and Communication
As necessary, training with respect to the MSA Policy will be provided to educate on the importance
of implementing and enforcing effective systems in an effort to ensure slavery and human trafficking
is not taking place in our supply chain.
Ongoing Monitoring
If issues are identified in relation to modern slavery, these will be dealt with by the Legal & Compliance
Team or as otherwise specified by applicable Carlyle policies and procedures.
This statement will be reviewed annually.
The CELF board approved this statement on 29 June 2017. It has been signed by a designated member
and such signed copy is available upon request.

The statement covers the activities of The Shropshire Group
of companies in the UK up to 7th May 2017.
Introduction
G’s is aware of the modern slavery risks
and acknowledges responsibility to the
Modern Slavery Act 2015. We are
committed to establishing action plans
to eradicate acts of slavery and human
trafficking from our own businesses and
from within our supply chain.
We
also
endeavour
to
achieve
transparency within G’s and with its
suppliers and focus on continuous
improvement. Moreover, G’s commits to
respecting human rights and will avoid
infringing on the human rights of others
and will address any issues that are
identified. This will include taking
adequate measures for prevention,
mitigation and, where appropriate,
remediation of incidences of modern
slavery found in our business and in our
supply chain.

Structure of the business
G’s is an international farming business
established in 1952. Today we supply all
the major UK retailers and many in
Europe with fresh vegetables and
prepared produce. We remain a family
business with very strong values for its
people, its customers, the environment,
nature and its suppliers. Across the
Group, G’s policies and management
systems are aligned to our common
values and the aims of ethical
treatment of those who work on our
sites.
In addition to business units within the
Shropshire Group, this approach is
extended across a wider sphere of
influence including key suppliers, labour
providers and the G’s Growers Producer
Organisation.

The majority of our products come from
our owned farms, packhouses and food
preparation facilities located in the UK,
Spain, Czech Republic, Poland, Senegal
and the USA. In most of these countries
our seasonal workers are employed from
abroad.
Especially in the UK, we employ a large
number
of
seasonal
workers
predominantly
coming
from
EU
countries. We directly recruit the
majority of our seasonal workers.
Furthermore,
G’s
provides
accommodation, social activities and
welfare support on many of its sites.
In addition to our own sites, the
business also utilises a range of
suppliers from 25 different sourcing
countries to ensure year-round supply.
Our top 10 sourcing countries by gross
sales value during the financial year
2016/17 were:
TOP 10 SOURCING COUNTRIES
UK
SPAIN
SENEGAL
EGYPT
HOLLAND
MOROCCO
ITALY
GERMANY
USA
PORTUGAL

All suppliers are held to account via a
comprehensive ethical due diligence
and supplier approval procedure.

Review May 2016 to April 2017

Outlook May 2017 to April 2018

G’s owned business

G’s owned business

In 2016/17 our focus was on seasonal
labour and external labour providers in the
UK and Spain.

After in-depth modern slavery training for
the whole Ethics team through a renowned
consultancy and GLAA, we have expanded
our key areas of risk. In 2017, our focus
was on seasonal labour and the relating
thereto external labour providers. In
addition, we have now increased our focus
areas for our own business units beyond
third-party labour providers, to the entire
recruitment process, and hidden thirdparty exploitation outside the workplace.
Furthermore, the dedicated Ethics team
has been expanded to further support thus
mitigating the risk of modern slavery in our
own business and supply chain.

Seasonal Labour
Enabling communication is one of the most
powerful tools we have to detect
exploitation. All seasonal workers have
received inductions with understandable
information regarding modern slavery.
Furthermore, posters with modern slavery
information and a link to our hotline as
well as external support have been
distributed in all UK sites. When
confidential grievances have been raised
through our Speak Up hotlines, these have
been actioned accordingly.
Labour Providers
Audits: All labour providers supplying the
G’s Spanish and British farms have been
audited and assessed by our dedicated
Ethical Audit team. Through this process,
standards have been raised and knowledge
improved within our labour providers.
The Ethical Audit team has attended
modern
slavery
and
exploitation
prevention training by the GLAA, as well as
specific
training
regarding
audit
techniques to uncover exploitation. Audit
methods have been updated accordingly
and are being used to benchmark all labour
providers against best practise standards
for preventing labour exploitation.
Risk Assessment: All agencies have
undergone a risk assessment based on both
intrinsic factors as well as audit results and
the
result
of
the
best
practise
benchmarking standards.

G’s Supply Chain
Approval: In 2017, technical and ethical
due diligence has been brought together
under a common Supplier Approval
Procedure. Ethical approval is dependent
on a combination of due diligence and risk
assessment. Each supplier needs to
complete as a minimum a questionnaire
covering modern slavery related due
diligence procedures.

Labour Providers
Audits: The experienced team will
continue to audit all labour providers
supplying the Group twice-yearly with an
updated audit methodology including
Stronger Together checks.
Risk Assessment: The score from the risk
assessment will be used to measure the
exposure of risk the business has via its
labour providers. In 2018, we will report
back the result from our risk assessment
and give valuable consultancy to our
businesses.
Communication: It is important to enable
good communication across all workers in
order to detect exploitation. Additional
measures will also be taken to ensure
meaningful communication with agency
workers. The following additional tools
have been developed and will be rolled out
at all sites which use external labour
providers; regular sample surveys checking
for key indicators, giving information
regarding modern slavery to agency
workers during site inductions, and
ensuring agency representation in worker
committee meetings.

Recruitment
G’s has formal HR procedures which
guard against informal recruitment. Our
actions this year will be to increase the
depth of knowledge we have regarding
anyone who may have introduced an
applicant to the company.
Mapping Introduction Channels: We
will standardise the new starter
protocol to ensure full information
regarding anyone who may have
introduced a candidate to the company
is captured during interview, and create
appropriate data fields in the HR system
to ensure that this is reportable.
Training: Any person in a role involved
in induction or recruitment will have
third party modern slavery and
exploitation
training
added
as
‘mandatory’ on the G’s Learning
Management System and will receive
this training in modern slavery
awareness.
Hidden third-party exploitation
The greatest risk of modern slavery in
our business is the occurrence of hidden
third-parties engaged in exploitation of
our workers via debt bondage, threat,
and housing control outside of G’s. To
tackle this often hidden problem,
several measures have been put in place
for prevention and detection.
Information for all Workers: Our
inductions will be standardised to
include understandable information
regarding modern slavery. Along with
our induction pack, we will provide
background information on life in the UK
including rights, typical costs and public
services.
Confidential Reporting of Grievances:
G’s operates both an internal helpline;
the People’s Helpdesk, and a third party
confidential hotline; SpeakUp. These
are vital avenues of support for anyone
who is experiencing a problem which
they feel unable to report through the
usual channels. In 2017/18 we aim to
increase awareness of this hotline,

measuring
success
via
additional
questions in our staff survey.
Workers’ Committees: The G’s People
Forum is an essential channel for
communication, and to engage on any
possible signs of exploitation in the
workplace. All of our G’s People Forum
representatives will receive training on
modern slavery and be encouraged to
add issues to their agenda.
Embedding & Training: In order to
ensure that our anti-slavery procedures
are effective and fully implemented,
the company has formed a Modern
Slavery Steering Group composed of HR
and Ethics teams, which is consulted on
relevant procedure development and
how it could be best implemented in all
areas of a diverse business.
This steering group has additionally
identified responsible parties for each
business unit as Site Champions for
modern slavery. These Champions will
receive
comprehensive
third-party
training in recognising and supporting
victims,
as
well
as
in-depth
understanding of the issues. They will
be responsible for driving forward the
implementation of relevant procedures,
raising awareness onsite, and will be
equipped to know how to react if a case
of exploitation is found.
Furthermore, these Site Champions will
be empowered to cascade training to
key people on their site – such as line
leaders and worker representatives.
These roles will have modern slavery
training marked as ‘core’ within the G’s
Learning Management System, ensuring
coverage going forward as new people
move into those roles. This training will
specifically focus on spotting the signs
of labour exploitation and how to report
it using our dedicated reporting tools.

Monitoring: General awareness of the
signs of modern slavery in the workplace
will be increased at all levels and
employees encouraged to report ‘yellow
flags’ via established channels. Central
analysis will pull together these alerts
from multiple sources to establish any
patterns
which
require
further
investigation. Data collection for these
alerts will be further enhanced by
establishing
improved
additional
interviews with new starters during
their onboarding process, and additional
key reportable fields in the HR system.
Victim Support Process: In addition, we
also recognise that the process after
discovering a potential victim of
exploitation is important and to
establish a victim support procedure
including NGO’s and other support
offered.

G’s Supply Chain
We are primarily a producer business,
but do use third party suppliers to
ensure constant supply throughout the
year. As these operations are outside of
our direct control we have to rely on
information provided to us by our
suppliers. We have therefore set-up a
number of due diligence techniques to
ensure the risk are mitigated.
Risk Assessment: The Ethics Team will
develop a risk matrix for all suppliers
across the G’s group, where possible
through to grower level. The data for
the risk assessment is in the first place
derived from site data, a registration in

the ethical database SEDEX which
includes a detailed self-assessment
questionnaire, country risk scores from
credible indices, and 3rd party audit
history.
Supplementary
information
which is relevant to assessing for risk of
modern slavery is also collected via an
internal approval system, second-party
ethical audits, and visits by technical
teams.
All information will be incorporated into
the overall risk score for all G’s
suppliers. When a risk score of a site is
high or medium for a programmed
supplier, we seek to mitigate that risk.
By influencing procurement decisions
and mitigation activities, we aim to
reduce the overall risk score in our
supply chain.
Training: All of our Tier 1 suppliers will
be requested to conduct appropriate
modern slavery training.

This statement has been approved by
John Shropshire, Chairman of G’s Fresh
on the 15th September 2017. It will be
reviewed and updated annually.

DISCLOSURES
Corporate Disclosure in Compliance with SB657
California Transparency in Supply Chains Act
At Pharmavite, we are rmly committed to human rights and ethical standards of conduct in our business practices, and we seek strong
partnerships with suppliers who share these same values. It is with these principles in mind that we will be requiring our suppliers to comply
with our Supplier Code of Conduct which sets forth speci c guidelines regarding labor, human rights (including a prohibition on slavery and
human tra cking), health and safety and the environment.
On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) went into effect, requiring retailers and manufacturers
above a certain size doing business in California to disclose what efforts, if any, they have taken to eliminate slavery and human tra cking
from their direct supply chains for goods offered for sale. The disclosure is aimed at providing information to consumers, allowing them to
make better, more informed choices about the products they buy and the companies they support.
Veri cation: Pharmavite is actively engaging, through internal processes, in the veri cation of our product supply chain to evaluate and
address risks of human tra cking and slavery. These internal processes include mapping our actual supply chain and examining not only the
places we purchase from but also the types of products we are purchasing in order to determine the risks of human tra cking and slavery
associated with the sourcing location and the product sourced. Pharmavite has engaged a quali ed third party to assist it in assessing these
risks. In compliance with US federal and state laws, Pharmavite itself uses only voluntary labor and does not engage in forced or involuntary
labor of any kind or in human tra cking. In addition, Pharmavite’s Supplier Code of Conduct requires suppliers to only use voluntary labor and
to refrain from using forced or involuntary labor (including slave labor, indentured labor, prison labor, bonded labor and other forms of labor
provided or obtained by force, fraud, coercion or threats) or participating in human tra cking.
Auditing: Pharmavite requires suppliers to disclose all facilities producing products for Pharmavite. These facilities will be required to
adhere to Pharmavite’s Supplier Code of Conduct. Based on the risk assessment conducted as part of Pharmavite’s veri cation of its product
supply chain, certain suppliers will be subject to periodic audits, either unannounced or pre-arranged, by a quali ed third party expert and/or
by Pharmavite’s in-house auditors. Such audits will include on-site factory inspection and con dential interviews with employees and, where
applicable, on-site contract workers.
Upon completion of all audits, the identi ed issues and recommendations to rectify violations observed will be discussed and documented
with the audited facility. Factory management will be expected to address all identi ed issues as noted.
Certi cation: We also will be requiring our suppliers to certify their compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct, including that the
materials incorporated into the products sold to Pharmavite were produced in compliance with the laws regarding slavery and human
tra cking in the country or countries in which they are doing business.
Accountability: Pharmavite maintains internal accountability standards for its own compliance with US federal and state laws including
those relating to lawful labor practices. Pharmavite intends to hold suppliers accountable for their non-compliance with Pharmavite’s
Supplier Code of Conduct. If Pharmavite discovers a violation of our Supplier Code of Conduct by a supplier, Pharmavite’s focus will be on
working with the supplier to remedy the violation, upholding workers’ rights and improving the overall workplace environment. If a supplier
does not correct the violation, we are prepared to end the relationship with that supplier.
Pharmavite’s senior leadership will have direct involvement and accountability for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the Supplier
Code of Conduct. Periodic reports regarding supplier compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct will be provided to Pharmavite’s senior
leadership.
Training: Pharmavite employees and management, who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, are being provided with
training on human tra cking and slavery, particularly with respect to identifying and mitigating risks within the supply chain of products.
This training is being provided by a respected third party.

California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010
Scholle IPN Corporation and its subsidiaries proudly support the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (Act),
which prohibits slavery and human trafficking from its supply chain for tangible goods offered for sale. In compliance with the
Act, Scholle IPN Corporation trains its supply chain employees and management with respect to mitigating slavery and human
trafficking risks within the supply chain of its products, and, upon request, obtains written verification from its suppliers that
materials incorporated into supplier’s products purchased by Scholle IPN comply with applicable laws regarding slavery and
human trafficking in the country or countries in which the suppliers are doing business. In accordance with the Act, Scholle IPN
directly obtains self-certification of compliance from its suppliers, in lieu of less effective unannounced verification audits
conducted by itself or third parties. Violations of the Act shall be referred to Scholle IPN’s Legal department for appropriate
follow-up, in accordance with its accountability practices.

Transparency in Supply Chains Statement Pursuant to Section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery
Act of 2015
This statement is made on behalf of Scholle IPN UK Ltd., the local affiliate of the Scholle IPN global network of companies.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND COMMITMENTS
Modern slavery encompasses human trafficking, forced labor and servitude. Scholle IPN has a zero-tolerance to modern
slavery of any kind. We acknowledge that companies can play an important role in eradicating this global challenge by
implementing business practices in their operations which affect the qualification and ongoing engagement of their supply
chain.
The success and sustainability of our company are, to a great extent, contingent on the respect and dignity with which we treat
our employees. Scholle IPN strongly opposes the use of child labor, forced labor, and all other forms of human exploitation
whether physical, emotional or psychological in nature.
We are committed to acting ethically and with integrity and transparency in all business dealings and to implementing effective
systems and controls to safeguard against any form of slavery in our business. We expect our vendors and suppliers to apply
the same standards and will continue to work with them to further develop and implement mechanisms toward this goal.

BUSINESS STRUCTURE
Scholle IPN is an industry-leading performance packaging company that manufactures flexible packaging solutions for a
variety of applications including food, beverage, and industrial markets around the world. We offer bag-in-box, aseptic pouch

packaging, plastic films, filling equipment, and packaging components like fitments and connectors.

Relevant Business Practices and Policies
Scholle IPN implements a series of internal practices to ensure that we are conducting business in an ethical and transparent
manner consistent with applicable laws in all jurisdictions where we operate. Our stance against any form of modern day
slavery is reflected in the following Scholle IPN business practices and policies:
Hiring and Employment Policies: Scholle IPN job applicants do not have to pay any fees to be considered for a position at
Scholle IPN. Our talent acquisition processes include verification of eligibility for all job candidates. We only hire persons 18
years of age or older. We do not retain any government issued forms of identification presented by job candidates or
employees in connection with our eligibility verification requirements or as a condition of employment. We meet or exceed the
minimum wage standards in all jurisdictions where we operate.
Whistleblowing Hotline. The company has an open-door policy: Employees can report any complaints to their supervisors,
Human Resources, the Legal Department and/or the facility manager of each Scholle IPN location. In case employees prefer
to raise issues anonymously, they are aware that they can call our Ethics Hotline anonymously and without fear of reprisals.
The availability of this multi-language resource is advertised through postings placed in the common areas / lunch rooms of all
of our global facilities.
Code of Ethics. This document highlights the principles guiding the manner in which we conduct business. It includes the
company’s expectations of our employees and business partners concerning all forms of modern slavery. New employees
are made aware of this policy as part of their onboarding process. Existing employees receive periodic refresher courses
carried out in conjunction with our International Business Policy.

Our Supply Chain
Scholle IPN operates with a supplier policy and maintains an authorized supplier list. To qualify as a Scholle IPN supplier, our
prospective business partners first undergo a clearance / due diligence process which helps us confirm their standing as law
abiding corporate citizens. As part of doing business with Scholle IPN, in addition to our due diligence process, our providers
must also agree to grant our purchasing personnel and audit teams access to their facilities for verification of their
manufacturing processes, practices, and working conditions.
Most of our suppliers are large, established world-class manufacturers who are contractually obligated to comply with all
applicable laws including prohibitions on the use of forced labor and human trafficking. The failure to comply with our business
standards will be considered by us as a contractual breach and may result in the termination of our business relationship with
any non-compliant parties.

Our Performance Indicators
The effectiveness of our practices and policies in respect of avoidance of human trafficking and other forms of modern day
slavery will be evident if no reports are received from employees, the public, or law enforcement agencies to indicate that any
instances of such practices have been identified.

ABMA Rules and Directions for the Use of Aseptic Bags
The good preservation of the product is directly related to connect with the correct utilization of the aseptic bags. The following
instructions are of importance:

PRESERVATION AND HANDLING:
If the carton containing the aseptic bags is received damaged, to such extent that the contents are exposed, do not use the
bags. Keep the aseptic bags in protected warehouses and under correct environmental and hygienic conditions. Bags must
be stored between 5°C (41°F) and 32°C (90°F).
In particular keep bags away from:

• high temperatures
• direct sun
• poisonous or ill smelling articles.
The bag will remain aseptic if not tampered with. Be careful not to damage the bags when opening the boxes. Collect the bags
from their boxes individually only at the moment of the filling process, carefully avoiding any possible damage.
All bags remaining after filling operations must be carefully packed in the original cartons in order to avoid bag damage. It is the
expectation that unfilled bags will be suitable for use 36 months from the date of Manufacture, provided that the storage and
warehousing conditions detailed above are adhered to. It is recommended that the principle of ‘First in First out’ should be
applied on unfilled bags If this time period is exceeded it is a requirement to contact your bag manufacturer prior to usage.

IRRADIATION:
Cartons are identified with a irradiation indicator. Always check that the irradiation indicator dots (indication the bag aseptic
conditions) are of the correct colour, which is red. Never use boxes with a yellow dot (bags are not irradiated). In case of doubt,
please contact your supplier in writing within 7 days after receipt of the bags.

OUTER CONTAINERS:
The dimensions of the bags are proportionate to the size of the outer container. The dimensions of the bags will have to be
determined by supplier’s technicians: the internal size of the outer container must be advised upon placing the order for aseptic
bags. The inner side of the outer container must be free from cutting edges, scratches or impurities, in order to avoid damage to
the bag (cuts, holes) during filling and transport operations.

FILLING:
Handle the aseptic bag with care during the filling operation ensuring the bag is correctly held by the pincer/clamps to minimise
the strain applied to the fitment. During filling, the bag film should not be in direct contact with hot parts on the fill head. Avoid
steam or hot condensate from flowing on to the bag film during the filling process.
The container lift system or fill head movement should ensure that the product load is supported by the container during the
complete filling process. The establishment of the correct sequence of outer container lift or fill head movement steps should
minimize the weight carried by the fitment with the pincer/clamp only releasing at the end of the cycle. It is particular important
to check that the closure is correctly placed in the spout. After filling, carefully fold the empty corners of the bag towards the
center, taking care to avoid creases and smoothing the surface. Make sure that the filled bag is completely supported by the
outer container.

CLOSING:
Avoid the introduction of any foreign bodies which may damage the aseptic bag. Take care not to pinch the bag with the cover
when closing the outer container. The cover of the outer container must close tightly. It is important to keep a record of the
production date, the filling head number, the temperature of the filling head and the bag number going with each outer
container. This will avoid handling of all outer containers in case of accidents, because it will enable you to identify and to sort
out the claimed lot, thus saving time and money and allowing immediate control and evaluation of eventual damages.
IMPORTANT: For Liquid Product Bags
Avoid head space between the filled bag and the top cover of the drum or other outer container.
Should head space exist, it should be completely filled in order to prevent excessive movement of the bag within the outer
container.
• When the viscosity is less than 500 CP (at 20°C, BROOKFIELD) it is necessary to consult the suppliers technicians.

Sterilizing Process During the Filling Operation:
STERILIZING LIQUIDS:

The under-mentioned conditions are to be respected in case of the use of sterilizing liquids. The chlorine salts, which are used
in solution for sterilization in the filling areas, must have chlorine concentration not higher than 250PPM and they must be
buffered so as to keep the pH of the solutions at 7 + 1. Carefully remove excess sterilizing liquid once the bag has been closed.
Metal attack which may occur as a consequence of not respecting the above conditions, will not be recognized. Usage of other
sterilization liquids will be subject to approval of both bag and filler supplier.

HOT STEAM STERILIZATION:
In case of steam sterilization up to 105°C, only bags with suitable fitments and films for this particular system must be used.

STORAGE AND TRANSPORT OF FILLED CONTAINERS:
In order to get a good result, the filled containers must be adequately protected against sun, rain, dust and excessive
temperatures. The filled containers must be placed and tied firmly together on proper pallets during factory shifting and
shipping, to avoid any kind of movement.
Do not transport filled containers at temperatures below 1°C, to avoid ice forming on the surface of the product, which could
irreparably damage the bag.

NOTE:
The aseptic bag is only one of the elements of a system for the preservation of a product. It is clear that any stage before the
filling operation (for example during the sterilization of the product) can cause problems that are not related to the bag. It is
therefore essential, in case of a claim, that supplier’s technicians are allowed to verify the production process and records (in
particular records of temperatures in the filling head during production) and also maintenance actions on the filling machine
before the aseptic season, in order to identify the true origin of the problem. No damage claims will be accepted without proper
documentation on part of the customer.

1. Introduction
This is the BDZ Group's first modern slavery statement. This statement will be updated again in November 2019.

2. The BDZ Group
The BDZ Group, incorporating ARC companies, was established in 1983 to offer corporate clients consulting services relating to people, management and property.
The BDZ Group has subsequently grown into a £40m+ turnover business, supplying goods and services through a diverse group of companies in various sectors - including property
part-exchange, air packaging, electroluminescent lighting technology, corporate relocation, website design and development, property redevelopment and the sale of musical
instruments.
BDZ Investments Limited is the holding company for the group.
The companies within the BDZ Group, which have met the turnover threshold for modern slavery reporting are BDZ Holdings Limited and PX-Partnership (UK) Limited.

3. The BDZ Group's commitment to tackling modern slavery
The BDZ Group supports the UK Government's attempts to tackle modern slavery, which it recognises as being: (a) a heinous crime involving the abuse of human rights through the
exercise of control (usually be exploiting vulnerability); and (b) both a UK domestic and international issue.
The BDZ Group also acknowledges that slavery is one (important) issue within the broader sustainability agenda, involving more extensive environmental, social, human rights and
labour issues encompassed within BDZ's Core Values and Supplier Code of Conduct.
The BDZ Group is committed to 'doing the right thing' through its respect for, and promotion of, core labour standards which support equality and social justice. BDZ is opposed to
unfair competition through a 'race to the bottom' on workers standards - which can lead to abuses of freedom, dignity and decency, as well as weakening workers' positions
globally, and increasing poverty.

4. Existing steps taken by the BDZ Group
Before the current financial year, the BDZ Group was already taking measures to safeguard against modern slavery. These included:

1. Carrying out eligibility to work checks at the recruitment stage;
2. Undertaking supplier checks (supplier due diligence, visits and inspections); and
3. Having a whistleblowing policy - so employees know that they can come forward and raise any issues or concerns confidentially without fear of reprisal.
However, the BDZ Group recognised that there were more steps it could take to combat modern slavery. The measures which BDZ is now taking are set out below.

5. Policies, procedures and practices
During the current financial year, the BDZ Group has:

1. Undertaken a review of its existing business and supply chains (domestic and international) to identify and analyse risks of modern slavery. While this review has
initially focused on core suppliers, consideration is also being given to ancillary suppliers(where there is the potential for reduced transparency and increased risk).
2. We have begun an ongoing process of due diligence, monitoring and continuous improvement, to obtain reliable information from suppliers and ensure good
practice in tackling modern slavery (to include working with suppliers to educate them on and address any potential current slavery risks).
3. Updated existing supply agreements, to include specific obligations and warranties regarding modern slavery, and to provide it with enhanced inspection and
audit rights.
4. Put in place new policies in respect of modern slavery, including a new Supplier Code of Conduct.
5. Increased awareness of the risk of modern slavery throughout its business, (initially) at recruitment and managerial level, through the provision of information and
training, including ensuring that staff know how to spot potential modern slavery and when and how to report it.
6. Provided company managers with direct responsibility for supply chain management.
7. Been mindful of the need to ensure that it does not contribute to the use of illegal or unethical employment practices within its supply chain (e.g. by ensuring that
undue time and cost pressures are not placed on suppliers and that suppliers are paid on time).

6. Measuring effectiveness
The BDZ Group will measure the effectiveness of its performance in tackling modern slavery across its business and supply chains by:

1.
2.
3.
4.

Regularly reviewing the effectiveness of its modern slavery policy and Supplier Code of Conduct;
Continuing to raise staff awareness on the risks of modern slavery, and undertaking testing as part of an ongoing training programme;
Continuing to risk assess, monitor and work with suppliers to ensure compliance with our modern slavery policy and Supplier Code of Conduct; and
Keeping up to date with and auditing compliance with modern slavery laws and guidance.

7. The impact of BDZ's Group efforts to tackle modern slavery
By taking the above steps, the BDZ Group:

1.
2.
3.
4.

Assumes corporate responsibility by committing the most vulnerable members of society;
Seeks to maintain and develop strong relationships with suppliers, based on transparent, stable, reliable and robust supply chains;
Aims to support staff retention and loyalty through a group culture based on the values of mutual respect, excellence, trust and sustainability; and
Intends to protect and enhance the value of its brand.

This modern slavery statement has been approved by the board of PX-Partnership (UK) Limited.

Modern Slavery Act

MODERN SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
STATEMENT
Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights under the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
It takes various forms, including slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking, all
of which have in common the deprivation of a person's liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal
or commercial gain. Keele University is committed to improving our practices to combat modern slavery and
human trafficking.

ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE

and, in particular, to ensure the proper management and financial solvency of the institution. Major policy decisions, as well as
corporate strategy, are also subject to its approval. The Council has a majority of lay members (neither employees nor students of the
University) and includes among its members representatives of staff and students. The Vice-Chancellor has general responsibility to the
Council for maintaining and promoting the efficiency and good order of the University.

The University Executive Committee (UEC) is the primary executive committee of the University and acts as an advisory committee to
the Vice- Chancellor in leading the strategic direction of the University. Membership of UEC comprises of the Vice-Chancellor (chair);
the Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Provost; the Chief Operating Officer; Pro Vice-Chancellors; Deans of the Faculties; and Directors of the
professional service functions.

The University has a global annual turnover of circa £170m; is the largest campus university in the UK of around 618 acres; and is
home to approximately 10,000 students.

The University is dedicated to exhibiting best practice in all aspects of corporate governance and to supporting the UK Government’s
National Action Plan to implement the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

OUR POLICIES ON SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
The University endeavours to ensure that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our
business.

Our workplace policies and procedures demonstrate our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business
relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking
place anywhere in our supply chains.

The University has comprehensive recruitment procedures and requires all staff participating in the process to undertake recruitment
training which includes content relating to modern slavery and human trafficking, in order to support legal compliance and best practice
in this area. Robust checks are carried out to ensure that all new staff have the right to work within the UK. Where it is necessary to hire
external agency workers, our staff are directed to specified agencies that have undergone appropriate evaluation.

The University implements its own Whistleblowing Policy regarding concerns about illegal or unethical conduct. If any modern slavery
cases were to be suspected on site, any alleged violation of human rights would be fully investigated, and formal action taken as
appropriate.

The University recognises that it has a legal duty of care with respect to safeguarding and has put appropriate procedures in place in
relation to this. The Safeguarding Policy (and associated Safeguarding Procedure) provides details of the necessary steps to be taken
should allegations be raised of harm or abuse (including human trafficking) against children or vulnerable adults.

SUPPLY CHAINS
Modern slavery and human trafficking forms part of the University’s Sustainable Procurement Strategy.
The University has a supplier database of over 2,000 suppliers and our procurements can either be through a regional Higher Education
purchasing consortium or through direct contracting. All procurement activities are managed through a centrally controlled Procurement
department, which sits within the Finance Directorate.

The University purchases a wide range of products and services. The main categories of expenditure are as follows

Laboratory consumables and equipment
Estate-related
Professional services
Library
IT equipment and services
Catering

We work with our suppliers using an online tool provided by NetPositive Futures that asks and actively assists all our suppliers to
develop an action plan that addresses modern slavery and other key sustainability issues within their businesses and supply chains. In
this way, the University is taking pro-active steps to ensure its contracting arrangements comply with all the relevant legislation in both
of these areas.

We contact our suppliers to ask them about impacts arising from their business activities, including slavery within their supply chains
and providing an opportunity for them to tell us how they are addressing these issues. The same process is used for all new suppliers.
To date 996 of our suppliers have accessed the tool and we are using the information to understand the status of these activities in our
supply base and to encourage and support good practice.

To enable us to target our analysis to ensure we focus on areas at potential risk of incidents of modern slavery in the supply chain, we
have analysed our supply base and we continue to monitor the following high-risk areas:

Information technology equipment
Furniture
Catering
Construction and maintenance services

1. Information technology equipment
Forced labour is recognised as high risk in the electronics industry throughout developing countries. The University purchases the
majority of its IT and IT consumables from framework arrangements that are managed by a Higher Education consortium: the London
Universities Purchasing Consortium. The University is a member of The North Western Universities Purchasing Consortium (NWUPC).
NWUPC is an affiliate member of Electronics Watch on behalf of its members. Electronics Watch is an independent monitoring
organisation that assists public sector buyers to meet their responsibility to protect the human rights of electronics workers in their
global supply chains.

2. Furniture
As a member of NWUPC, the University purchases the majority of its furniture from frameworks that are managed by the NWUPC. The
levels of risk have been identified within the category strategy document by the NWUPC and appropriate actions considered. The
University monitors risk at regular review meetings with suppliers using supplier action plans which have been developed using the
NetPositives Future tool.

3. Catering
As part of the University’s Sustainable Food Policy the University prioritises ethical and responsible sourcing by (a) purchasing high
welfare meat and dairy products; (b) sourcing sustainable seafood that is Marine Stewardship Council certified; and (c) sourcing fairly
traded food, drink and other products for our operation. The University purchases food through frameworks which are managed by The
University Caterers Organisation Ltd which is committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking within its
supply chains.

4. Construction and maintenance services
The University procures the majority of construction and maintenance services in line with its tendering procedures, whereby all
construction procurements (irrespective of whether the value of the works is above or below the OJEU threshold) include as part of the
selection stage evaluation a pass/fail assessment requiring the tenderer (and also each key subcontractor/member of the bidding
consortium as applicable) to confirm that either:
(a) they are not a relevant commercial organisation as defined by section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015; or
(b) they are a relevant commercial organisation and can demonstrate compliance with the annual reporting requirements contained
within section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

This approach is consistent with the Government’s Procurement Policy Note: Standard Selection Questionnaire. Successful contractors
are encouraged by the University to follow the Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code which is founded on the conventions of the
International Labour Organisation and is an internationally recognised code of labour practice.

The University will occasionally procure works via a call-off under an existing public sector framework agreement established by
another contracting authority but will still include the same Modern Slavery pass/fail assessment within the further competition
evaluation. Large maintenance services contracts procured by the University also follow the same approach.

STAFF TRAINING AND AWARENESS

We are continuing to undertake the following steps in order to raise awareness and understanding regarding the issue of modern
slavery and human trafficking in supply chains:

A group of senior University officers oversees current awareness activities and meets at least annually to ensure adequate
awareness- raising is taking place.
The group ensures that the University’s annual Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement is up to date. The statement is
agreed by the University Council and signed off by the Vice-Chancellor.
Training is undertaken by staff in those functional areas identified as requiring significant awareness of the risks regarding modern
slavery such as Procurement and areas of commercial and Estates-related activities, over 100 staff have completed an e-learning
module on Modern Slavery and Human Rights.

OUR PLANS FOR THE FUTURE
We commit to better understand our supply chains. We will continue to implement and develop the following action plan to identify and
mitigate any risks that Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking represent in our business and supply chains:

We will continue to raise awareness of modern slavery issues amongst our suppliers and staff, encourage transparency amongst our
suppliers and continue to carry out supplier risk assessments where concerns arise. Sharing our due diligence practices in relation to
modern slavery and human trafficking with our suppliers and partners.
We will review and monitor supplier action plans through regular contract management and support initiatives to reduce the risk of
modern slavery and human trafficking occurring.
We will continue to review and monitor supplier action plans developed through the NETpositive toolkit.
We will continue to provide training for relevant staff on compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
We will continue to review and update all relevant policies and controls in order to embed awareness in relation to modern slavery
and human trafficking.

This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our slavery and human
trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 July 2020.

Relevant policies

The organisation operates the following policies that describe its approach to the
identification of modern slavery risks and steps to be taken to prevent slavery and human
trafficking in its operations:
•

Whistleblowing policy - The organisation encourages all its workers, customers
and other business partners to report any concerns related to the direct activities, or
the supply chains of, the organisation. This includes any circumstances that may
give rise to an enhanced risk of slavery or human trafficking. The organisation's
whistleblowing procedure is designed to make it easy for workers to make
disclosures, without fear of retaliation. Employees, customers or others can raise
their concerns verbally or in writing, in accordance with our Whistleblowing policy.

•

Employee code of conduct - The organisation's code makes clear to employees
the actions and behaviour expected of them when representing the organisation.
The organisation strives to maintain the highest standards of employee conduct
and ethical behaviour when operating abroad and managing its supply chain.

•

Supplier/Procurement code of conduct - The organisation is committed to
ensuring that its suppliers adhere to the highest standards of ethics. Suppliers are
required to demonstrate that they provide safe working conditions where necessary,
treat workers with dignity and respect, and act ethically and within the law in their
use of labour. The organisation works with suppliers to ensure that they meet the
standards of the code and improve their worker's working conditions. However,
serious violations of the organisation's supplier code of conduct will lead to the
termination of the relationship.

•

Recruitment/Agency workers policy - The organisation uses only specified,
reputable employment agencies to source labour and always verifies the practices
of any new agency it is using before accepting workers from that agency.

•

Corporate Social Responsibility - Operating in a responsible and sustainable
manner is important to R&M Electrical Group Ltd. Whilst we run our business in
line with the expectations of diverse global stakeholders, we also see corporate
responsibility as a discipline that helps us to manage risks and maximise on the

Scope
Playtech is committed to upholding and promoting human rights across our global operations and
supply chain. This is a core part of our overall commitment to becoming a more sustainable business
and playing a positive role in society. As part of this commitment, we are taking action to improve our
understanding and mitigation of human rights and modern slavery risks as they relate to our industry,
geographic footprint, operating model, supply chain and employment practices. We also recognise
that the Covid-19 pandemic has the potential to negatively impact the situations of people trapped in
modern slavery around the world.
This statement is made pursuant to Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out the steps
that Playtech has taken during the ﬁnancial year ending 31 December 2019 to prevent modern slavery
from occurring in its operations and supply chains, as well as its plans for the future.

Overview
Playtech Plc and its subsidiaries (the “Group’’) are committed to upholding human rights in their
operations and supply chain. This is a core element of the Group’s overall commitment to responsible
business practices.
The Group supports and adheres to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, the International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at
Work and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
The Group is committed to upholding human rights and ensuring that it is not complicit in the violation
of human rights. This includes human trafﬁcking and slavery, which can occur in many forms including
forced labour, child labour, domestic servitude, sex trafﬁcking and workplace abuse.
In addition, Playtech’s pledge to uphold human rights and tackle modern slavery in its supply chain will
be reﬂected as a speciﬁc commitment in its new ﬁve year sustainability strategy, which will be
launched during 2020.

About Playtech Plc – Business Structure and Supply Chain
Playtech Plc is one of the world's largest suppliers of online gaming and sports betting software,
including business intelligence driven gambling software, services, content and platform technology.
Playtech Plc is the parent company of the Group and has its head ofﬁce in the Isle of Man.
Details of the Group’s principal subsidiaries can be found in Note 37 on pages 156-157 of the Annual
Report 2019, which can be found on www.investors.playtech.com.
The Group has more than 6,000 employees located in 21 countries. Playtech also owns and operates
the leading sports betting and gaming brand in online and retail in Italy, Snaitech. Playtech's Financials
Division, named TradeTech Group, is a technology leader in the CFD and ﬁnancial trading industry
and operates both on a B2B and B2C basis. In its operations, the Group primarily procures technology
and infrastructure products and services including software, hardware and data hosting services and
professional advisory and support services. The Group's three major areas of procurement spend are:
technology (cloud services, hardware and mobile services); marketing; and property services (leasing,
facilities and cleaning). Between them, these three categories account for a signiﬁcant proportion of
global procurement spend.

Policies, Governance and Accountability

The Group operates to the highest business, employment and recruitment standards and has a zerotolerance policy towards human rights violations. Every employee has the responsibility to uphold the
principles set out in this statement in addition to complying with the Group’s ethics and compliance
policies. The Group requires all employees to adhere to both these principles and all related policies,
practices and procedures.
This statement will be disseminated to employees on an annual basis and will be available on the
Playtech Plc website and intranet. This statement will also be referenced and reﬂected in the Group's
updated corporate policies, which are disseminated to employees and contractors on an annual basis,
alongside the Group’s new sustainability strategy and commitments.
In 2019, the Group created a new global and centralised procurement function and appointed a new
global head of procurement. As part of this new structure, a new operating model has been introduced
with the objective of strengthening governance, compliance and responsible business standards.
Human rights have been integrated as part of this new structure, in line with the Group's overall core
strategy.
As a result, the Group published its procurement compliance policy this year. The policy included
speciﬁc elements to reﬂect the Group’s commitment to protecting human and labour rights in the
supply chain. To ensure the successful roll-out of the new policy, 56 procurement employees in key
markets received tailored training on it. The Group also continues to promote an independent,
conﬁdential ""Speak Up"" line for employees to use to report any ethical or legal concerns. This is
highlighted and discussed with employees on induction and during annual compliance training.
The Group will continue to review the implementation of its ethics and compliance policies as part of
its Group risk, audit and assurance processes. In 2020, the Group will publish new employee
safeguarding and anti-discrimination policies and update its existing Business Ethics and Speak Up
policies.
The Group's Risk and Compliance Committee has ultimate responsibility for reviewing the
effectiveness of this statement. This Committee continues to set the agenda and monitor the
implementation of strategy and progress related to responsible business, ethics, regulatory affairs and
compliance. Non-Executive Director, Claire Milne, has been Chair of the Committee since 2018, and
also serves as the Board-level champion on these topics. Details of the Group's responsible business
governance structure can be found in the Annual Report 2019.
Due Diligence Processes, Risk Assessment and Training
As a provider of software and services to the gambling and ﬁnancial trading industries, human and
labour rights and modern slavery issues do not pose the same level of risk for the Group as they do
for companies in the manufacturing or industrial sectors. The Group’s most salient human and labour
rights issues revolve around employment, data protection, procurement of goods and services and
anti-money laundering (with special regard to ensuring that persons involved in human trafﬁcking and
modern slavery cannot launder money through the Group's operations). In 2019, Playtech conducted
a comprehensive review of its compliance risk across the Group, which included a review of human
rights and modern slavery risk. The aim of the review was to surface and prioritise risks across its
business and value chains. As part of this review the Group:
Updated its human rights risk assessment, which helped the Group identify the areas of highest
risk within its business operations. This process included in-depth review of the Group's human
rights and modern slavery risks across business units and geographies as well as key functional
areas such as employment, procurement, and data protection. The risk assessment
methodology included conducting interviews with key management, reviewing anonymous
surveys completed by 36 functional and business unit managers and undertaking an
independent review by external legal advisors
Continued to include human and labour rights risks as part of business partner due diligence and
onboarding.

Through the use of the Group's online KYC and compliance monitoring tool, monitored 427
suppliers, 253 Playtech subsidiaries and 353 directors of third party suppliers for compliance
issues including human rights and modern slavery risks.
Continued to embed legal and compliance requirements in third party contracts, including those
related to human and labour rights, anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and corruption, ethics,
data protection and anti-facilitation of tax evasion.
Continued to promote the independent, conﬁdential ""Speak Up"" line to employees, suppliers and
business partners.
Following on from the ﬁndings of the compliance risk review, the Group has put in place a set of action
plans covering key areas of the business. These plans will continue to form part of Playtech’s effort to
minimise and mitigate compliance risks in 2020. Proposed actions include:
Strengthening capabilities within the procurement and human resources functions through
additional training and guidance.
Reviewing and tracking actions and improvements in country-level procedures and protocols,
including third party recruitment and employment arrangements, in high risk countries. High risk
countries are deﬁned to align with high risk countries listed in independent indices covering
human right and corruption risks, such as the Global Slavery Index and Transparency
International’s Corruption Perceptions Index.
Strengthening compliance processes as part of the implementation of the new procurement
function, systems and procedures.
Continuing to increase awareness of human rights and modern slavery as part of the Group’s
new sustainability strategy and related policies.
Monitoring functional and business unit actions resulting from the 2019 human rights risk
assessment.
During 2019, we have delivered refresher training on human rights to 40 human resources,
procurement and technology managers across the Group operations.

Future Plans
Upholding and promoting human rights is a core part of the Group’s overall commitment to responsible
business practices. This is why we will continue to strengthen Playtech’s approach to this issue.
During 2020, we will continue to actively deliver on the action plans put together this year as a result of
our new human rights risk assessment. This includes continuing to strengthen the capabilities of our
procurement and human resources functions, to raise employee awareness of the issues, and to
improve monitoring so as to track progress. In relation to the ﬁnal point, the Group will monitor and
track the risks identiﬁed as part of its quarterly compliance risk assessment process, its due diligence
monitoring, its independent ""Speak Up"" line and its audit and assurance processes. Commitments will
also be tracked as part of the Group wide sustainability reporting. Additionally, the Group will record
any human rights ﬂags identiﬁed as part of compliance monitoring conducted on third party business
partners. The company monitors third party risks through an online compliance monitoring tool
designed to assess and monitor compliance, regulatory, legal and reputation risks of third parties.
Cases ﬂagged for human rights concerns will then be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to further
assess the risk and what additional controls may be required.

The Group will publish new employee safeguarding and anti-discrimination policies and update its
existing compliance policies, including the Group Business Ethics Policy and Speak Up Policy. The
Group will continue to review the implementation of its policies as part of its Group risk, audit and
assurance processes.
In 2020, the Group will deliver refreshed and tailored training on human rights to build capacity and
skills amongst relevant employees and senior managers, with a particular emphasis on managers in
key functional roles, such as human resources and procurement.
This statement will be updated annually to reﬂect the Group's ongoing focus on these issues.
This statement was approved by the Board on 19 May 2020.

Decidebloom Limited strictly prohibits the use of modern slavery and human trafficking in our
operations and supply chain. We have and will continue to be committed to implementing
controls aimed at ensuring that modern slavery is not taking place anywhere within our
organisation or in any of our supply chains. We expect that our suppliers will hold their own
suppliers to the same high standard.
Modern slavery and Human trafficking
Modern slavery can take various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory
labour and human trafficking. Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human
rights.
Commitments
We shall be a company that expects everyone working with us or on our behalf to
support and uphold the following measures to safeguard against modern slavery:
•

We have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery in our organisation and our
supply chains.

•

The prevention,detection and reporting of modern slavery in any part of our
organisation or supply chain is the responsibility of all those working for us or on our
behalf. Workers must not engage in, facilitate or fail to report any activity that might
lead to, or suggest, a breach of this policy.

•

We are committed to engaging with our employees, via online learning tools, in order
that they may recognise and report any concerns, regarding the risk of modern
slavery in our operations.

•

As part of our risk assessment and due diligence processes we will consider
whether circumstances warrant us carrying out audits of suppliers for their
compliance with our anti-slavery and human trafficking legislation.

•

If we find that other individuals or organisations working on our behalf have breached
this policy we will ensure that we take appropriate action. This may range from
considering the possibility of breaches being remediated and whether that might
represent the best outcome for those individuals impacted by the breach to
terminating such relationships.

This statement is made pursuant to Section 54, Part 6 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out
the steps The David Ross Education Trust has taken and is committing to take to ensure that
slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our supply chains or in any part of our
business.
Our Structure, our business and our supply chains
Established in 2007, The David Ross Education Trust is a Multi-Academy Trust, sponsored by The
David Ross Foundation. At August 2018, it comprised 34 academy schools across the country. Our
schools range from smaller rural primaries with around 50 children, to much larger secondary
schools in the centre of urban areas.
As part of the education sector, the Trust recognises that it has a responsibility to take a robust
approach to slavery and human trafficking and is committed to acting ethically and with integrity
when acquiring goods and services.
Policies
The Trust reviews policies and procedures on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain compliant and
fit for purpose. The following policies and procedures are considered to be key in meeting the
requirements of the Modern Slavery Act.
Safeguarding and Child Protection Policy
The Trust embraces its responsibility to develop, implement and monitor policies and
procedures to safeguard the welfare of children. The Trust has a comprehensive Safeguarding
and Child Protection Policy which all Trustees, Governors and staff are expected to read and
comply with. The policy which is reviewed annually is compliant with statutory guidance
‘Keeping Children Safe in Education’.
HR / Employment Policies and Practices
The Trust is highly committed to advancing equality, eradicating unfair treatment, and
promoting good relations across and between all our communities.
We have clear and rigorous HR policies and procedures and high standards for employees that
minimise the risk of any form of modern slavery existing within the organisation.
The Trust has procedures and policies in place on all major employment issue, for example,
disciplinary, grievance, harassment and bullying, Code of Conduct, Whistleblowing
Procedures, as well as other policies that support fair treatment of employees including
attendance management and ill health capability, performance capability, performance
management, recruitment and selection.

Recruitment
The Trust’s recruitment processes are transparent and reviewed regularly. They include
robust procedures for vetting new employees, which ensures they are able to confirm their
identities and qualifications, and they are paid directly into an appropriate, personal bank
account. All Trustees, Governors and Staff are required to have an Enhanced Disclosure and
Barring Service check which details all criminal history; cautions, warnings, reprimands and
convictions held on the Police National Computer. To comply with the Asylum, Immigration
and Nationality Act 2006, all prospective employees are asked to supply evidence of their
eligibility to work in the UK. References are also requested and followed up writing and
verbally.
Agency Workers
The Trust uses only reputable employment agencies to source labour and verifies the practices
of any new agency it is using before accepting workers from that agency. These agencies are
audited to ensure they meet all legislative requirements.
Codes of Conduct
The Trust’s Code of Conduct for Employees, and for Trustees and Governors makes clear the
actions and behaviours expected of them when representing the Trust. The Trust strives to
maintain the highest standards of employee conduct and ethical behaviour and breaches are
investigated.
Whistleblowing
The Trust encourages all its employees to report any concerns relating to activity that is
deemed illegal, unethical, or not correct within the organisation. The Trust’s procedure is
designed to make it easy for employees to make disclosures, without fear of harassment or
victimisation.
Procurement Contractors and Service Providers
The Trust uses a range of suppliers for a wide variety of supplies and services which can make
it challenging to effectively review and challenge all suppliers. At present the Trust does not
conduct audits of its suppliers and their business activities nor does it investigate working
conditions in its supply chains in any other way.
We have identified that some of our procurement takes place within sectors where modern
slavery offences are more likely to occur, such as within our cleaning and catering supply
chains and within the construction industry.
The David Ross Education Trust is committed to better understanding its supply chains and
will work towards achieving greater transparency in the processes that go into providing our
services.

Equality and Diversity
As a major employer and provider of education we are committed to advancing equality of
opportunity and providing fair access and treatment in employment and when delivering
education. To support our commitment to equality, we embed equality and diversity into our
everyday business. We expect all our Trustees, Governors and staff to treat everyone with
dignity and respect and provide the best possible standards of education to all of our pupils.
Training and Awareness
The Trust has a programme of induction and ongoing mandatory training that all employees
must complete, including Safeguarding Training which is undertaken annually. This enables
individuals know how to recognise and report incidents of abuse and neglect, including
modern slavery and human trafficking.
Further Actions
Following the production of this statement, The David Ross Education Trust commits to undertaking
the following steps over the next academic year:
•
•
•
•

Circulate this statement to all staff to raise awareness of the policy.
Circulate information and training to make staff aware of the key signs of modern slavery
and what to do if they suspect that someone might be in slavery.
Put processes in place to assess, for material procurement projects (new contracts and
renewals), the risk exposure relating to modern slavery, and for those projects identified as
high risk,
Seek to obtain assurance that potential suppliers have appropriate controls in place to
mitigate the risk of modern slavery within their organisation.

This statement was approved by the Trust Board on 21 March 2019 and will be reviewed annually.

The Modern Slavery Act 2015 requires organisations supplying goods or
services with a turnover of above £36 million to prepare and publish an annual
‘Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement’. The Statement must set out the
steps an organisation has taken, if any, during its financial year to ensure that
slavery or human trafficking is not taking place in its supply chain. In addition
to the Council’s responsibility as an employer, it also acknowledges its duty as
a Borough Council to notify the Secretary of State of suspected victims of
slavery or human trafficking as introduced by section 52 of the Modern
Slavery Act 2015.

What is Modern Slavery?
Modern slavery is an international crime, affecting an estimated 29.8 million
slaves around the world. It is a growing global issue that transcends age,
gender and ethnicities. It includes victims who have been brought from
overseas and vulnerable people in the UK, who are forced to illegally work
against their will across many different sectors such as agriculture, hospitality,
construction, retail and manufacturing. In 2014, the Home Office estimated
there were between 10,000 and 13,000 potential victims of modern slavery in
the UK.
Our Policy
Tamworth Borough Council adopts a zero-tolerance position on known
violations of anti-human trafficking and anti-modern slavery laws. We are
committed to improving our practices and ensuring there is no modern slavery
or human trafficking in any part of our business and in so far as is possible
requiring our suppliers to hold similar ethos.
Our Structure
The Council is located in the south east corner of Staffordshire. The district
covers 11.91 square miles, is the smallest of the eight Staffordshire districts
and has a population of approximately 77,200. The Council’s 2016/17 annual
turnover was £70,788,000. The Council provides a range of services to
residents, businesses and visitors. This includes waste collection and
recycling, collection of council tax and business rates, housing, homeless
support, parks and open spaces, planning and building control, street
cleaning, promoting economic growth and regeneration, environmental health,
leisure services, community safety and election administration. Services are
delivered through a mixture of direct provision, commissioned services,
contracted services, joint/shared services and partnerships.
Policies and Procedures
We have a number of policies and procedures in place that contribute to
ensuring modern slavery does not occur in our business or supply chains,
these include:
1

Safeguarding
The Council embraces its responsibility to develop, implement and monitor
policies and procedures to safeguard the welfare of children and ‘adults at
risk’ and has a comprehensive policy which all staff and councillors are
required to read and work within. The Council works within multi-agency
partnerships to protect and safeguard people and has identified two lead
officers for modern slavery.
Recruitment
The Council currently has 443 employees and uses robust recruitment
processes, in line with UK employment laws, including ‘right to work’
document checks and contracts of employment.
The Council operates a Job Evaluation Scheme to ensure that all employees
are paid fairly and equitably. When the Council uses employment agencies to
source labour it verifies the practice of any new agency it is using before
accepting workers from that agency.
Code of Conduct
The Council’s Employee Code of Conduct and Members’ Code of Conduct
makes clear to employees and members’ the actions and behaviours
expected of them when representing the Council. The Council strives to
maintain the highest standards of employee and member conduct and ethical
behaviour and any breaches are investigated.
Whistleblowing
The Council encourages all its employees, customers and other business
partners to report any concerns related to the direct activities or the supply
chain of the Council. The Council’s whistleblowing procedure is designed to
make it easy for employees to make disclosures, without fear of retaliation.
Supply Chains
The Council recognises that the organisation is exposed to greater risk when
dealing with contractors and service suppliers. The Council has a wide range
of suppliers delivering services across all directorates. The Council aims to
reduce the risk of modern slavery in its supply chain by undertaking the
following actions:
•
•
•
•

Where appropriate require key contractors to have safeguarding policies,
procedures and training in place, in addition to providing confirmation of
compliance with the Modern Slavery Act
Consider modern slavery factors when making procurement decisions
Include modern slavery criteria in specification and tender documents
where appropriate.
Evaluate specifications and tenders

Employee Training
The Council wants its employees to understand more about this growing issue
and how to report any suspicions they may have, whether in a work or
personal context. Information on Modern Slavery was incorporated into the
2

Council’s safeguarding policy and also included within Level 1 safeguarding
awareness training in 2016. At present any concerns can be reported to the
Safeguarding Officer.
Looking Forward
Going forward the Council will strengthen its approach to tackling modern
slavery by:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Ensuring modern slavery information is available to all staff
Commissioning a bespoke modern slavery training session to all staff and
members
Developing a range of resources for staff and making this information
available on our website
Mapping supply chains to understand where modern slavery and human
trafficking risk lies
Undertaking risk assessments where deemed necessary
Gaining better understanding of our suppliers structure, business and
supply chains
Identifying services that are more vulnerable to modern slavery and
seeking assurance that their supply chain is free of modern slavery and
human trafficking
Considering how we seek assurance from small to medium – sized
enterprises (SME) that they comply with the Modern Slavery Act.
Identifying key performance indicators to measure the effectiveness of our
procurement process Encouraging suppliers and contractors to take their
own action and understand their obligations to the requirements.

This statement has been approved by the Council’s Senior Management
Team. It will be reviewed and updated within six months and thereafter
reviewed and updated annually. The statement with associated actions will be
reported to Audit & Governance Committee and Cabinet each year for
monitoring and assurance purposes.

The organisation is absolutely committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking in its corporate
activities, and to ensuring that its supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking.
Organisational structure and supply chains
This statement covers the activities of PPF Group Ltd.
PPF Group Ltd operates under three trading names.
rd

o

ADR Network is involved in the supply of HGV drivers to major retailers and 3PL’s (3
party logistics companies). This brand focuses on Lead Vendor services whereby we

TW Network supplies warehouse operatives within its ‘industrial’ arm of the division.
TW Network also supplies drivers to companies on a spot hire basis. Unlike our Lead
Vend solutions within ADR Network, TW Network focusses on lower volume business
where typical cover may be for absence, sickness and holiday.

Countries of operation and supply
The organisation currently operates in the following countries:
UK only.
The following is the process (and steps taken by the company) by which the company assesses
whether or not particular activities or countries are high risk in relation to slavery or human trafficking:
High-risk activities
The business has determined that all activity within our supply chain is low risk. We meet
face to face with all Suppliers providing driving services and go through a thorough approval
process before placing any individual on assignments. All agency staff that we directly
engage with on a contract of employment are subject to a vigorous registration process.
Only those individuals that we meet face to face are presented for assignments. High risk
activities will be reviewed annually along with the entire policy.
Responsibility
Responsibility for the organisation's anti-slavery initiatives is as follows:

Policies: All policies are reviewed annually by the HR Director and Managing Director.
External advice is sought where appropriate, and the Directors responsible are committed to
keeping updated with current and pending legislation changes.
Training: Operational Directors meet with the Board Directors every quarter to discuss and
implement any new training requirements. The business runs 4 communications days each
year with its entire staff. These events are held for training and business updates. Any
subsequent training requirements are dealt with in groups of no more than 10 on a case by
case basis. Email is used to update the company with any relevant bulletins.
Relevant policies
The organisation operates the following policies that describe its approach to the identification of
modern slavery risks and steps to be taken to prevent slavery and human trafficking in its operations:
Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy The policy outlines the company stance in
relation to Modern Slavery and the responsibilities it expects from everyone working for the
business to uphold the policy.
Whistleblowing policy The organisation encourages all its workers, customers and other
business partners to report any concerns related to the direct activities, or the supply chains
of, the organisation. This includes any circumstances that may give rise to an enhanced risk
of slavery or human trafficking. The organisation's whistleblowing procedure is designed to
make it easy for workers to make disclosures, without fear of retaliation. Employees,
customers or others who have concerns can phone our head office on 01582 393500 and
request to speak with a Board Director. Where possible, your call will be dealt with strictly
confidentially.
Code of business conduct The organisation's code makes clear to employees the actions
and behaviour expected of them when representing the organisation. The organisation
strives to maintain the highest standards of employee conduct and ethical behaviour when
operating in the uk and abroad and managing its supply chain.
Supplier Agreements The organisation is committed to ensuring that its suppliers adhere to
the highest standards of ethics. Suppliers are required to demonstrate that they provide safe
working conditions where necessary, treat workers with dignity and respect, and act ethically
and within the law in their use of labour. The organisation works with suppliers to ensure that
they meet the standards of the code and improve their worker's working conditions.
However, serious violations of the organisation's Supplier Agreement will lead to the
termination of the business relationship. Suppliers providing driving services to PPF Group
nd
Ltd are required to undergo an on-line audit and work to the conditions set out in our 2 tier
supplier agreement. Following a successful supplier setup, an annual desk audit then takes
place.

update it annually.

Modern Slavery and Human Tra cking Statement
2018/19
Introduction
This statement is made pursuant to section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. It constitutes Lakeland
Limited’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ended 31st December 2018.
Our Organisation
Lakeland is a UK, family-owned retailer with over 50 years’ experience of specialising in cooking, baking,
cleaning & laundry products. We have a reputation for extraordinary service, innovative products and high
levels of customer care. We employ around 1,400 staff, most of whom are directly employed and we
recognise the huge contribution they make to our business.
As a multi-channel retailer, we sell our products in 67 retail stores in the UK, our website and via catalogues,
as well as on a number of 3rd party marketplaces.. We also have an International franchise partner in the
Middle East.
Our Supply Chain
In order to find the newest and most exciting innovations for the home, our Buyers travel all around the world.
Much comes from the Far East and we have our own Far East sourcing offices in Shanghai and Hong Kong.
These support our Buyers and provide a local resource to oversee our suppliers and manage the local supply
chain.
Many of our ‘finds’ are also sourced in the UK, including the majority of our food range, where we support
many smaller Artisan producers. The Buying and Merchandising team in the UK carefully manage these
relationships.
Our warehousing is company owned and based locally in Kendal. We receive products in and then distribute
out to our 67 stores and to our franchise partner in the Middle East.
Our Policies
We are committed to ensuring that as a business, we adopt high ethical standards. We also expect all
suppliers and partners, wherever they are based in the world, to do the same. We recognise it is our
responsibility to ensure that our suppliers are observing and adhering to our working practices and as such,
we review and improve our policies regularly.
Lakeland company policies directly related to the identification and control of modern slavery include:
New suppliers’ selection, both branded and own label
An ethical trading policy and whistle blowing policy.
Due Diligence
As the first point of contact with suppliers, the Buying department is responsible for assuring compliance

within the supply chain.
As part of our due-diligence process of taking on new suppliers and partners they are expected to complete
our ethical trading questionnaire to ensure that they meet our standards, and comply with the requirements of
the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
All new, directly sourced own-brand manufacturers and franchise partners are also visited by a member of the
Lakeland team or nominated third party auditing body.
Lakeland is a member of the SEDEX ethical collaboration platform and we actively encourage suppliers to
become members of SEDEX or comparable platforms such as BSCI.
As part of supplier setup we carry out risk assessments on the supplier and product type to determine if we
need further information. We organise audits or obtain audit reports for those suppliers of Lakeland branded
products in high risk countries or industries. From the audit results the suppliers are then graded and reviewed
at regular intervals.
For suppliers deemed lower risk we clearly communicate our modern slavery policy and ask for confirmation
of compliance. We also ask branded suppliers to confirm they meet these standards or provide us with their
own policy document.
We have made progress over the last year in mapping our existing supply chain and checking ethical
information is up to date. In some cases we have commissioned extra audits or moved products to different
factories if we aren’t satisfied with their responses.
Lakeland undertake to investigate thoroughly and quickly any instances of non-compliance to ensure all of our
suppliers comply with the Modern Slavery act 2015.

Training
We are currently reviewing what training and resources need to be made available on Modern Slavery for our
staff. HR and Buying are collaborating on developing resources to be used in induction and training for staff
via the in-house training application. Information on recognising Modern Slavery and whistle blowing will also
be put on the application.
Looking Ahead
We are currently looking at carrying out risk assessments for suppliers of services for compliance with
Modern Slavery requirements. This will include temporary agencies and providers of logistics which are
considered to be higher risk for modern slavery issues.
We will continue to ensure our supply chain is fully mapped and audits and corrective actions are carried out.
We are in the process of developing an IT system which will help us monitor suppliers more effectively. Once
this is live we will review setting targets and measures in relation to Modern Slavery.
Approval
This statement has been formally approved by the board members of Lakeland Limited and signed on their
behalf.

Definitions
The Group considers that modern slavery encompasses:
•
•
•
•
•

human trafficking
forced work, through mental or physical threat
being owned or controlled by an employer through mental or physical abuse
of the threat of abuse
being dehumanised, treated as a commodity or being bought or sold as
property
Being physically constrained or to have restriction placed on freedom of
movement.

Commitment
The Group acknowledges its responsibilities in relation to tackling modern slavery
and commits to complying with the provisions in the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The
Group understands that this requires an ongoing review of both its internal practices
in relation to its labour force and, additionally, its supply chains.
The Group does not enter into business with any other organisation, in the United
Kingdom or abroad, which knowingly supports or is found to involve itself in slavery,
servitude and forced or compulsory labour.
No labour provided to the Group in the pursuance of the provision of its own services
is obtained by means of slavery or human trafficking. The Group strictly adheres to
the minimum standards required in relation to its responsibilities under relevant
employment legislation in England, Scotland and Wales.
Supply chains
In order to fulfil its activities, the main supply chains of the Group include those
related to the supply of Roofing goods such as slate from various suppliers in the
United Kingdom. We source from a variety of manufacturers of roofing and related
products. The vast majority of products used are specified by our client base. We
receive goods via a mix of direct to site deliveries and also from national distribution
chains. We endeavour at all times to ensure that all suppliers to the Group are fully
compliant with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
Potential exposure
The Group considers its main exposure to the risk of slavery and human trafficking to
exist where product is sourced from an intermediary and the saving is from a
worldwide supply base. In general, the Group considers its exposure to
slavery/human trafficking to be relatively limited.

Steps
The Group carries out due diligence processes in relation to ensuring slavery and/or
human trafficking does not take place in its Group or supply chains, including
conducting a review of the controls of its suppliers.
The Group has not, to its knowledge, conducted any business with another Group
which has been found to have involved itself with modern slavery.
In accordance with section 54(4) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, the Group has
taken the following steps to ensure that modern slavery is not taking place:
•

Annually contact our entire supply base seeking confirmation of the
compliance with the Act

•

Review responses to identify areas of higher risk

•

Where a clear risk is seen to exist we seek further assurances from the
suppliers – this may result in site visits to complete our investigations

•

From the investigation will, if required, implement joint actions plans with the
supplier and address any concerns

•

If we cannot obtain confirmation of compliance from a supplier, we may
determine to de-list them in extreme cases

•

Continuing to develop further standards and policies in order to support our
Anti-Slavery policy

Key performance indicators
Avonside uses due diligence key performance indicators to measure effectiveness in
ensuring that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in the supply chain.
Policies
The Group has the following policies which further define its stance on modern
slavery; Corporate & Social Responsibility Policy, Anti- Slavery & Human Trafficking
Policy and a strict Recruitment Policy which includes checks to ensure potential
employees are able to work in the UK.
Slavery Compliance Officer

modern slavery should be addressed, and who will then undertake relevant action
with regard to the Group’s obligations.

INTRODUCTION
This statement is being published in
accordance with the Modern Slavery
Act 2015. It sets out the steps taken
by CP Foods (UK) Ltd during year
ending 31st December 2018 to prevent
modern slavery and human trafficking in
its business and supply chains.

CP Foods (UK) Limited is part of a global
business working with leading retailers,
manufacturers and restaurants to supply great
foods. We are an importer, manufacturer and
supplier of chilled, frozen and ambient food
products to businesses in the UK and the EU
with an export division supplying food products
to Asia.
This is our 3rd Modern Slavery statement and we
continue our commitment to addressing modern
slavery and human trafficking risks within our
business and our supply chains.
Focussing on our suppliers in Thailand we
have continued to develop and broaden our
knowledge of the risks to our business and
facilitated further in-depth research into our
supply chains going beyond tier 1. Along with
worker rights training and the introduction of a
Labour Voices hotline for all our Tier 1 and Tier
2 workers in partnership with the Labour Rights
Promotions Network (LPN).
Through collaboration with industry groups we
have continued to raise awareness of Modern
Slavery through a common approach identifying,
addressing and managing the risks of Human
Rights abuses of workers in our businesses and
our global supply chains and this work continues,
with a progression into our other Asian suppliers
including Vietnam and India.

POLICY & PRACTICES
CP Foods (UK) Ltd will not tolerate the abuse of human rights within any part of our business or our
supply chains and we take any allegations that human rights have not been properly respected very
seriously.
We actively recognise the importance of our participation in combatting modern slavery in our
business and our supply chains and have specific polices setting out our requirements as a business
and for our suppliers to adhere to.

Future Developments
We appreciate that this area is developing continually and we will review our policies to ensure they are adapted
to reduce the risks to our business. The need to work with our internal procurement and buying teams to develop
procurement and buying policies which embed human rights and align this policy with our anti-modern slavery
commitment has been highlighted within our business and this something we will be working towards in the coming
year.

All our policies are available to employees through our company intranet site and are included in the
induction programme for all new employees.

Any of the policies above are available on request to ethical@cpfoods.co.uk

RISK ASSESSMENT
Our due diligence process involves an annual assessment of our suppliers. To determine the risk
profile of each supplier we use the Food Network for Ethical Trade (FNET) country risk assessment
which combines published reports such as the Global Slavery Index, the US Trafficking in Persons
(TIP) Report and the ITUC Global Rights Index to give an overall risk rating by country.
A more detailed risk assessment of our supplier’s
industry sector in the producing country is then
carried out using the SEDEX Risk Assessment
tool which is populated by the industry leading
Maplecroft system produced by Verisk who
analyse Human Rights and Labour abuse risks
globally.
Where Tier 1 Suppliers are deemed Medium/
High or High Risk, as a minimum an annual
SMETA Audit is required by CP Foods UK, and
often customer specific ethical compliance audits
are also required.

CP FOODS (UK) LTD - Modern Slavery Statement 2018/2019

The outcome from these audits and other riskbased factors such as media coverage, industry
knowledge and historical knowledge is then used
to assess the risks of each supplier.
Some supply chains beyond Tier 1 which have
been identified as high risk are externally audited
against 3rd party standards, which include
the ethical treatment of staff including flags
for modern slavery. For example, we source
aquaculture products from supply chains certified
to Best Agricultural Practice (BAP); we source
poultry products from supply chains certified to
Genesis; and where palm oil is sourced, 100%
comes from Roundtable Sustainable Palm Oil
(RSPO) supply.

04

DUE DILIGENCE & ASSESSMENT OF SUPPLIERS & SUPPLY CHAIN
Having carried out a risk assessment on our supply chains, it is important this is followed by
adequate due diligence to identify issues that may indicate modern slavery. We have extensive
supply chains in high risk countries of Thailand and Vietnam and our efforts are focussed here.
Our high-risk Tier 1 suppliers have an ethical audit carried out by accredited third party auditors on
behalf of CP Foods UK. Based on risk this is done annually and is semi-announced. In our 2017 and
2018 audit reports common themes of excessive overtime hours and consecutive working days were
reported which are cultural norms. Though our sites comply with Thailand & Vietnam labour law we
are, through our strategic partners and stakeholders running a programme in the next year to review
these cultural challenges to find how we can make improvements.
In our 2017/2018 report we identified our poultry and shrimp farms as high risk and implemented a
programme to include these on our ethical platform. Thus far we have 76 poultry farms and 3 shrimp
farms in Thailand and 1 shrimp farm in Vietnam registered on the SEDEX platform and going through
the process of completing a human rights & ethical risk assessment. We have so far undertaken 2
shrimp farm audits and 2 poultry farm audits in our supply chain to ensure any non-conformance
are identified through our audit programme. During the next 12 months we will continue to carry
our audits on other poultry farms based on a statistical sampling rate which will ensure that all farms
receive an audit over a 4-year period.
Audits, however useful, are only one method of
due diligence in addition we carry out impact
assessments getting to the heart of our high-risk
supply chains were necessary. This year have
undertaken this programme in Thailand poultry
integrations with some credible results. There is
more work for us to do to improve the reporting
out of any issues raised through the hotline and
to share the structure of the labour voices hotline,
but we are making good progress here.
We have both internal and external grievance
mechanism at our farms and processing facilities
in Thailand as we see the value of both formats
for workers. Our first-year programme of Labour
Voices with an NGO in Thailand in CPF Poultry
and Shrimp integrations has been extended to
year 2. We will build on the programme of
migrant worker training of their employment
rights, supervisor training and hotline
management by providing focus group discussion,
new starter interviews and provision of other
access methods for raising their voice and being
heard.

DUE DILIGENCE & ASSESSMENT OF SUPPLIERS & SUPPLY CHAIN
The LPN programme will be rolled out to other non-CPF suppliers in Thailand next year.
In addition to the 3rd party grievance mechanisms we also provide effective internal programmes
through welfare committees by elected representatives, where any issues raised are documented,
investigated and reported out. We are also piloting “Ask your VP” suggestion box schemes to further
provide access for “Worker Voice”.
CP Foods UK have used our membership of the FNET to participate in the development of various
tools such as Employee Engagements training which has resulted in the provision of an animation
in various languages to help workers in supply chains to understand what modern slavery is and to
help them look for the risks. We have also participated in the development of tools for Responsible
Recruitment practices both in the UK and Asia. We work to ensure the tools are easy to use and
relevant to the audience.
We continue to actively participate in the
Seafood Taskforce with representation both
on the Board and leading 2 of the Sub
Group activities, as well as supporting and
driving change in the farm to Plant and the
Responsible Recruitment Group.
We recognise that there will be risks and
vulnerabilities in our supply chains and our
efforts to identify, Act and Remedy will ensure
we have sustainable ethical supply chains.
Through audit, Grievance Mechanisms and
Whistle blowing lines any issues highlighted
are reported in our KPI’s. In severe cases there
is a framework in place to remedy vulnerable
or at-risk workers whether that be in the UK
through local charities or GLAA, or in Asia
through on the ground NGO’s such as LPN.

see www.seafoodtaskforce.org

CASE STUDY
In collaboration with our strategic partners we carried out an impact assessment in September 2018 on our
Saraburi Chicken supply chain. This involved management and worker interviews at both our farms and processing
factories. Workers were independently interviewed to understand their awareness of and confidence in our Internal
and External Grievance Mechanisms. The External Grievance Mechanism is managed by LPN (An NGO working
on human rights in Thailand) via an independent hotline. The workers all reported they were fully informed of
the labour voices programme, but more importantly that it is trusted. Through worker interviews at the farm, all
workers reported that they would raise a grievance directly with the head of workers or HR Manager. Some workers
reported they did not have a copy of their contract so this was resolved immediately.

PARTNERSHIPS & COLLABORATIONS
We understand that the issue of Modern Slavery is a global issue and that we will not be able to tackle
it alone and that collaborations are fundamental to addressing and managing the risks.
The Food Network for Ethical Trade (FNET) was established in 2016 by a number of major UK food companies to
improve human rights in global food supply chains through a common approach to managing ethical trade. We aim
to support members to identify, manage and respond to global food supply chain ethical trade risks, to improve
the food industry’s understanding of ethical trade, to identify and facilitate collaboration opportunities, to promote
trust and to build a forum for sharing issues and best practice.

LOOKING AHEAD
As detailed in this statement, we have sought to adopt a thorough and robust approach to tackle
modern slavery in our business and our supply chains. We have good visibility of Tier 1 suppliers and
now Tier 2 in our complex supply chains to farms, hatcheries and feed mills.
Plans to improve training and capacity building in our business and supply chains will continue as well
as investing in industry collaborations which will enable and facilitate further improvement and impact
on other supply chains. This is a dynamic area for many businesses, and we continue to work with
external stakeholders to ensure we reflect this changing environment in our planning.
The Company will continue to enhance our policies and practices including encouraging further
implementation of worker voice mechanisms throughout more of our supply chains. This will aid
protection of worker rights and develop identification and remediation protocols.
This statement has been approved by the Board of Directors of CP Foods (UK) Limited and will be reviewed
annually.

Modern Slavery Act

Modern Slavery Act 2019 Statement
The Lind Group believes it is our responsibility to uphold the highest standards of
ethical behaviour and personal integrity within our business operations. Wherever
we do business, our employees are required to comply with all applicable laws, rules,
and regulations.
Modern slavery is a heinous crime and a morally reprehensible act that deprives a
person's liberty and dignity for another person's gain. Lind has a zero-tolerance
approach to modern slavery, and is fully committed to preventing slavery and human
traf cking in our operations and supply chain. As a company we are committed to
protecting our organisation and those people at risk from exposure to slavery or
human traf cking in our supply chain, both via our direct employees and those
working on our behalf via third party suppliers.
Organisational Structure and Background
The Lind Group represents premium automotive brands including BMW Motorrad,
Harley-Davidson, Porsche and Triumph from 9 dealerships across the UK. We're
continually investing in our facilities, employees, business partners and customers to
ensure we uphold our values and founding principals of Excellence, Integrity and
Service. This is why we're recognised year after year for delivering exceptional
customer experiences and our employees are renowned for their passion,
enthusiasm and knowledge.
The Lind Group is a trading style of Lind Group Holding Company Limited which is a
company registered in England with the company number: 06497578, our registered
address is: Brook Farm, Five Oak Green Road, Tonbridge, Kent, TN11 0QN. Our
subsidiary companies which are covered by this statement include: Lind AG Limited
(trading as: Porsche Centre Tonbridge), Lind Motorrad Limited (trading as: Lind
Motorrad), Lind US Limited (trading as: Lind Harley-Davidson, Guildford HarleyDavidson, Newmarket Harley-Davidson, Norwich Harley-Davidson, Reading HarleyDavidson and Lind H-D) and Lind Triumph Limited (trading as: Jack Lilley, Jack Lilley
Triumph, Lind Triumph, Triumph East London, Triumph London and Triumph North
London).

Our Employees
Our employees are all provided with a written contract of employment as well as
access to a company handbook which contains any policy that governs their
employment. Each employee has a personal responsibility to read the handbook, as
well as to ensure that they fully understand our obligations and the consequences
associated with any breach of those obligations. We are committed to
uncompromising integrity in all that we do and how we relate to each other and to
our customers.
It is a fundamental policy of Lind Group to conduct business with honesty and
integrity and in accordance with the highest standards of ethics, equality and fair
dealing. We appreciate the key role that Lind Group employees play in maintaining
high standards and ensuring as a business we are compliant in all aspects of
regulations set forth by the UK Government.
We encourage our employees to report any concerns related to the direct activities,
or the supply chain of, the organisation. This includes any circumstances that may
give rise to an enhanced risk of slavery or human traf cking. The organisation's
whistleblowing procedure is designed to make it easy for employees to make
disclosures, without fear of retaliation. These reports are reviewed by the most senior
directors of the Lind Group.
Our Third Party Supply Chain
The Motor Trade supply chain is one of the most complicated in any industry. The
breadth, depth and interconnectedness of the automotive supply chain make it
challenging to effectively manage and mitigate the risk of modern slavery. We also
recognise that the nature of the motor industry is such that our supply chain for new
and used vehicles is multifaceted as any given vehicle will have its own supply chain
for the various component parts. We therefore understand that ultimately our
vehicle supply chain begins with the sourcing and manufacturing of the raw
materials required for any part of a vehicle. As our relationship is with the vehicle
manufacturer and not with their supply chain, we're keen to engage with our
suppliers to ensure that they match our high standards and the ethos of the Modern
Slavery Act 2015 and lter this message down throughout their own supply chain.
We are committed to ensuring there is transparency in our own business and in our
approach to tackling modern slavery throughout our supply chains and expect the
same high standards from all of our contractors, suppliers and other business
partners. We establish a relationship of trust and integrity with all our suppliers,
which is built on mutually bene cial factors. The use of service provider contractors
in our organisation is largely within our facilities support area but not limited to this
part of our business.

Due Diligence
We have conducted a risk assessment of our business to assess the risk of modern
slavery and human traf cking. Based upon the results of this assessment and as part
of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk, we have undertaken the following
actions:
Built the assessment of slavery and modern traf cking risk into our supplier due
diligence process for areas of the business we deem to be high risk. We carry
out appropriate due diligence on the supplier, including requiring them to
complete a questionnaire on their own policies concerning the issue.
Developed a new Code of Conduct that highlights the standards of compliance
expected from all third party suppliers in areas of the business we deem to be
high risk. Third party suppliers and contractors we deem to be in high risk
business areas are required to sign to say that whilst carrying out its obligations
to the Lind Group they shall comply, and seek to ensure that each of its own
subcontractors and suppliers involved in the provision of goods and services,
comply with Lind Group Modern Slavery Act Code of Conduct.
Developed and implemented training to our Management Teams to identify,

Purpose
This statement demonstrates the commitment of North East Scotland College and its subsidiary companies to the
principles of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and specifically to section 54 (1). This statement will be reviewed each
financial year in accordance with clause 6 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

College Policy and Statement
North East Scotland College is committed to working towards the eradication of slavery and human trafficking.
This document acknowledges the legislation and laws implemented by the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and details
the steps that the organisation is taking to work towards the provision of the Act. We are committed to ensuring
that there is no slavery or human trafficking in our organisation and supply chains. This statement reflects our
commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and
enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in
our supply chains.

Organisational Structure and Supply Chains
North East Scotland College is the Regional College for the North East of Scotland, comprising the City of
Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire. It provides education to a wide range of learners from age 14 to adult.
The College’s subsidiary organisations include: •

Aberdeen Skills and Enterprise Training Limited, providing specialist training to the Oil and Gas Industry;
and

•

Clinterty Estates Limited, currently dormant.

The College has a number of suppliers for various parts of the organisation. These include: •

Agency staff including teaching and business support;

•

Business partners;

•

Apprentice employers;

•

External contractors including facilities management, cleaners, construction, and caterers;

•

Suppliers of goods, services and materials for teaching and business support;

•

Printing of College promotional materials; and

•

Advertising, including digital and print.

The College has adopted the Advanced Procurement for Universities and Colleges’ (APUC) Sustainable
Procurement Code of Conduct and we refer to this in our procurement exercises. The Code has been used in
APUC Framework Agreements since its inception in 2013. Through APUC, the College is as associate member of
Electronics Watch (an independent monitoring organisation working to achieve respect for labour rights in the
global electronics industry through socially responsible public purchasing in Europe).

Due Diligence Processes
The College is committed to ensuring there is transparency in our own business and in our approach to tackling
modern slavery throughout our supply chains. We expect the same high standards from all of our suppliers,
contractors and business partners, and this is assured through their agreement to follow College policies. We
expect our suppliers to hold their own suppliers to the same high standards. We are satisfied from our own due
diligence measures that there is no evidence of any act of modern day slavery or human trafficking within our
own organisation. The College’s supplier approval process incorporates a review of the controls undertaken by
the College’s potential suppliers. The College will not knowingly support or deal with any businesses found to be
involved with any acts of slavery or human trafficking. The College has a policy of zero-tolerance on matters of
slavery and/or human trafficking and expects suppliers and associated businesses to comply with these values.
The vast majority of the College’s sources are from inside the United Kingdom and as such are less at risk of
slavery and human trafficking issues. The College also has a policy for the protection of whistleblowers, to protect
those raising the issue of slavery and human trafficking within the organisation or its suppliers. The steps we will
take to further the goals of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 are: •

Conducting risk assessments to determine which parts of the College and its suppliers are most at risk
of modern slavery so that efforts can be focussed on those areas;

•

Engaging with our suppliers to convey to them the College’s position on modern slavery and to
understand the measures taken to prevent modern slavery in their own businesses;

•

Seek to introduce additional pre-screening measures for suppliers, where appropriate; and

•

Publishing this statement and on the College’s website to clearly display the College’s support to end
modern slavery.

Training, Awareness & Involvement
The College actively engages with the multi-agency Serious and Organised Crime (SOC) group, to assist in
promoting best practice and ensuring inter-agency approaches in tackling SOC.

Staff involved in procurement of goods and services attend training on ethical procurement.

Responsibilities
The Regional Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that this policy statement and its implementation
comply with our legal and ethical obligations. At an operational level, responsibility for the prevention of modern
slavery within the College and its supply chain rests with the College’s Leadership Team. Managers at all levels
are responsible for ensuring those reporting to them understand and comply with this policy statement.

Reporting Modern Slavery within the College or its Suppliers
The College’s whistleblowing and safeguarding policies are intended to provide guidance on how concerns can be
communicated to the organisation. Concerns about suspected modern slavery associated with the College or its
suppliers may be reported by employees in this manner. The aforementioned policies apply to employees and are
published on the College Intranet.

Communication and Awareness
This statement is displayed on the College website and on the College’s Intranet, and all staff are required to read
and indicate their understanding of it.
The Modern Slavery Statement will be reviewed yearly by the College’s Senior Executive Team.

Approved by North East Scotland College Regional Board

Martin Grant Homes Limited are proud of the ethical standards that it has embedded into its
business over many years, and believes that these standards are consistent with the
underlying principles of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. Slavery and the trafficking of people
have no place in the modern world, and Martin Grant Homes is committed to implementing and
enforcing effective systems and controls to enforce our zero-tolerance approach to modern
slavery and human trafficking.
Company Structure
Martin Grant Homes Limited is an independent and family owned housing developer and
builder employing directly circa 96 people. Our work takes place predominantly within London
and the home counties of the UK with an annual turnover of approximately £100 million.
This statement is made on behalf Martin Grant Homes Limited in accordance with the
requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, and its contents take account of the activities

Our policy on anti-slavery and human trafficking and our code of
conduct
Martin Grant Homes Limited are committed to ensuring, so far as we are able, that there is no
modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chain or in any part of our business
and we take a zero-tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking. Our supply chain
includes sub-contractors, suppliers, labour agencies and professional services providers.
Our Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy reflects a commitment to acting ethically
and with integrity in all of our business relationships, supported by the development and
implementation of effective systems and controls.
Our anti-slavery and human trafficking assurance process
As part of an initiative to identify and mitigate risk in respect of slavery and human trafficking we
will:
•

Carry out a slavery and human trafficking risk assessment to enable us to apply a
risk- based and proportionate approach to dealing with slavery and human trafficking
issues;

•

Update our Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy based upon our risk
assessment;

•

Review the contracts that we have with our supply chain and amended these to
require compliance with the Act;

•

Mandate, where appropriate, that our supply chain be registered with
the SMAS validation system, which requires our supply chains to confirm their
compliance with the Act;

•

Update our pre-qualification questionnaires (which form part of our process for
accepting our supply chain onto our approved supplier list) to include specific
questions on modern slavery and human trafficking. The responses to these
questionnaires are reviewed by our commerical team;

•

Obtain information on the measures that our supply chain are carrying out to
ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking is not taking place. Where we
consider that these measures are not sufficient, we will work with our supply chain to
improve their approach;
Widened the scope of the Martin Grant Homes Limited whistle-blowing procedure
to include the reporting of modern slavery and human trafficking issues, so that any
individual may confidentially raise a potential issue.

•

Training
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in
our supply chain and business we will provide training to our staff on the Modern Slavery Act
that is proportionate to the level of risk, comprising online and face-to-face training where
appropriate.
Future development
Continuous internal monitoring of our supply chain remains a priority for Martin Grant Homes
Limited. Those suppliers that have been identified as high risk will be more heavily monitored to
ensure that their working practices (and those of their supply chain) are compliant.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and
constitutes the slavery and human trafficking statement for Martin Grant Homes Limited for the
financial year ending 31 December 2018.

We procure a wide range of services and products around the world. These include facilities
management, maintenance and cleaning, recycling, office equipment and supplies, utilities,
marketing, communications, IT software and hardware, recruitment, temporary staffing,
management consultancy, and training.
We require all of our suppliers to comply with national and local, relevant law and
regulations.
We will not work with any organisation that has been or is found to be knowingly involved in
modern slavery. We have the right to audit our supply contacts and will fully investigate
where concerns are raised.
We understand that our biggest exposure to modern slavery is through our client-base.
While separate to our supply-chain, in 2019 we will review our processes to enhance
understanding of our clients’ policies with regard to modern slavery.
4. Governance
Our Corporate Ethics, Health and Safety, Corporate Social Responsibility and Whistleblowing

We recognise that our influence extends beyond our own operations to clients, local
communities and supply chains.
Our suppliers are procured directly with the oversight of our Risk and Assurance teams and
an appropriately authorised Accountable Executive in accordance with our documented
procurement procedure.
Suppliers must provide information about their anti-bribery, money laundering and other
financial crime controls, code of conduct and similar policies, approach to equality, inclusion
and diversity, health and safety and practices relating to the environment.

With the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, they must also attest that they are
not knowingly involved in modern slavery.
In 2018, we conducted an updated risk assessment on all aspects of financial crime,
including modern slavery. As a result of this assessment we introduced modern slavery to
our financial crime training programme.
In 2019, as one of the key potential areas of our exposure, we will place greater due
diligence focus on our construction finance proposition, while continuing to keep a riskbased approach to individual industry sectors. Specific measures include leveraging training
and guidance from trade body, UK Finance, on labour exploitation in vulnerable industries,
in addition to developing company-specific training for our Money Laundering Regulation

employees are able to raise concerns. We also have a risk incident reporting tool available to
all employees globally.

of our Corporate Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility programmes. The metrics we
report include:

Colleague engagement and satisfaction.
Completion rates of mandatory employee compliance training, including Corporate

partners. Colleagues have access to our Corporate Ethics and Whistleblowing policies and
are encouraged to raise any concerns about their treatment by the company, or individual
colleagues, in confidence and without fear.
In 2018, we continued to emphasise our commitment to conducting business in responsible
manner. We developed a new section of our mandatory corporate ethics training and elearning programmes to help colleagues identify signs of modern slavery, either in our
supply chains or amongst our client-base. Furthermore, we expanded our Corporate Social
Responsibility policy to provide further clarity surrounding modern slavery.
While we acknowledge that there is more we can do, we have specific plans to progress this
further in 2019. Specifically, we will provide dedicated training and support for our Money
Laundering Regulation Officers, and as part of our ongoing Financial Crime Compliance and
Anti-Money Laundering training programmes.

We and the Global Chief Executive, the Head of Learning and Development and the Head of
Corporate Communications ensure that all employees, contractors and relevant Business

Statement
Statement pursuant to Section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

Introduction
The Clancy Group Ltd (Clancy) is a people based business which values and invests
in its staff. Our people are the most important asset we have and as such we are
committed to making life better for all of our growing families. We are totally
committed to protecting our staff and workforce and embrace the legislation pursuant
to the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
This document constitutes Clancy’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the
financial year ended 31 March 2019. It covers the activities of Clancy and its
associated companies.
Clancy are an active member of the Home Office Gangmasters and Labour Abuse
Authority’s ‘Construction Industry Protocol’.

Our Business
Clancy are a national construction company directly employing over 2500 staff and
operating across the Water, Energy, Multi Utility, Rail and Infrastructure Civils sector.
Whilst the company tries to employ staff directly, due to the nature of the industries
within which we operate, it is sometimes necessary to utilise subcontractors and
other businesses.
Our clients include some of the largest businesses operating within the UK Water
and Energy sectors. We operate a Partnership model with clients whereby we
integrate our staff within these businesses to provide a seamless service for their
customers.
We take reasonable efforts to ensure our staff are properly trained for the activities
that they undertake.
The company’s annual turnover is in the region of £300 million.
The Clancy Group comprises the following companies:
•
•
•
•

The Clancy Group Ltd
Clancy Docwra Ltd
Clancy Plant Ltd
Clancy Developments Ltd

Our Supply Chain
Clancy use a range of companies who supply products used within our construction
and maintenance projects and a number of subcontractors who provide services to
our business and our clients.
We have a small number of product suppliers, direct or indirect, who manufacture
their products in countries classified as high risk on the Global Slavery Index. As
such these companies are challenged to ensure the same compliance with the UK
modern slavery legislation in so far as possible for a UK based operation. We also
ensure that their production facilities operate with consideration to both an ethical
and an environmental ethos. These companies are challenged when first obtaining
‘Approved supplier’ status and subsequently they are audited by our Procurement
Department to ensure these standards are maintained throughout their partnership
with our business.
All suppliers and subcontractors have to meet our expectations. All are contractually
bound with regards to Right to Work legislation, Anti-Bribery legislation and Modern
Slavery legislation.

Our Code of Conduct
We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in
our supply chains or in any part of our business.
Our ethical and sustainable Procurement Policy sets out our standards with respect
to buying goods and services; as well as detailing requirements with respect to
human rights, child and forced labour and modern slavery and UK Right to Work
legislation. This forms part of our contractual relationship with our suppliers and our
Whistleblowing Policy promotes the reporting of any concerns.

Due Diligence Process
Detailed due diligence is carried out on those suppliers where there may be a modern
slavery risk. Clancy have an established Security and Investigations department with
law enforcement experience who will investigate and report regularly to the
Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) Intelligence network.

Risk Assessment
We are aware that modern slavery risks can arise from all aspects of our business.
We have taken steps to ensure our Human Resources department, the Procurement
Department and all of our Operational teams are alert to the potential for engaging
with businesses whose ethics may not reflect those of the Clancy Group. As such
we audit suppliers if there is any reason for suspicion to ensure compliance.
Our staff are encouraged to report any concerns whatsoever to either their
managers, the Security team or using the whistleblowing hotline or email should they
wish to remain anonymous. This is not just limited to our schedule of works but to
any site where we have a presence and are not the primary contractor.

Our effectiveness in combating slavery and human
trafficking
As part of our ongoing commitment to combating slavery and human trafficking, the
Clancy Group has joined the GLAA Construction Industry protocol. Our Security and
investigations team have established contacts with both the GLAA investigations
team and the Home Office CITS forum and are currently creating a series of industry
workshops to highlight the potential of inadvertently engaging with businesses who
are either unaware of the risks or are operating illegally when it comes to modern
slavery. In addition, Clancy has a whistleblowing Policy and we encourage our
employees to raise any concerns using the confidential facilities and methods
provided if they see any conduct or behaviours that they feel are not appropriate.

Training
The primary purpose is to drive modern slavery from our industry. As such a series
of presentations and tool box talks are being given to all Clancy staff and
subcontractors working on our projects. The training is mandatory and is also
included in the induction pack of all new starters with our business.
The Security team keep a register of all notifiable events where liaison with the
GLAA has been necessary. The purpose of this allows our company to be able to
monitor and evaluate all intelligence and any subsequent lessons to be learnt. This
in turn allows training to be continuously updated and maintain its relevancy to
current trends.

Approval
This statement has been approved by the Board of The Clancy Group Ltd and is
signed on its behalf.
The Clancy Group Ltd are committed to achieving the highest level of ethical
standards and to implementing sound governance arrangements to ensure integrity
and objectivity in our business activity.
Approved by the Board on the 8th August 2019.

ANTI-SLAVERY

Anti-Slavery

THE LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB AND ATHLETIC GROUNDS LIMITED ANTI-SLAVERY AND HUMAN
TRAFFICKING STATEMENT
The Liverpool Football Club and Athletic Grounds Limited (""LFC"") recognises that the respect for human rights
is an integral part of its social responsibility as a responsible Premier League football club.
LFC has fostered and continues to foster an organisational culture that respects dignity and human rights. We
believe that conducting business with high ethical standards is fundamental to this culture.
LFC is also subject to the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (“Act”) and we are committed to
ensuring that no modern slavery takes place in our organisation. We also want to prevent workers from being
subjected to modern slavery in our supply chains and within the businesses of our partners.
This statement sets out the actions that LFC has taken to understand all potential modern slavery risks in
relation to its organisation and to put in place steps aimed at ensuring that there is no slavery or human
trafficking in its business and supply chains. This statement relates to actions and activities of the Club during
the financial year up to and including 31 May 2019.
Approach and Policies
We continue to review and ensure adherence to our Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking policy, which reflects
our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and sets out the steps that
we are continuing to take to combat modern slavery. We also ensure that our staff are reminded of the
importance of this policy and encourage them to raise concerns about any suspicion of modern slavery in any
part of our business or supply chains.
Additionally, our Supplier Code of Conduct requires all third parties working with LFC to comply with all labour
laws in the jurisdictions where they operate, and to take appropriate steps to ensure that there is no slavery or
human trafficking in their own supply chains.
LFC continues to undertake increased levels of due diligence on all proposed third parties prior to entering into
agreement with them to ensure that those third parties connected to LFC conduct themselves in a manner
conducive to the Act and to the highest ethical standards expected by LFC.
Supplier Mapping and Risk Assessment
As part of both the approval process for new suppliers and the continued review of existing own brand product
suppliers, LFC regularly requests evidence (via third parties who carry out audits on its behalf) that the ETI base
code is being followed by such parties involved in the production or manufacturing of LFC products.
During the next year, LFC aims to widen the scope of this process to enable even tighter and more detailed
controlled across third party manufacturing brands as well as own brand related suppliers.
This practice is part of a wider scale approach to ensure our systems:
Identify and assess potential risk areas in our supply chains.
Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our supply chains.
Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains.

Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains.
Protect whistle blowers.
Various teams within LFC work together to ensure the above process is thorough, and all-encompassing across
the business and effective. Whilst the process is ongoing and following its completion, LFC shall continue to
assess and mitigate any risks flagged and will continue to conduct such audits of our suppliers to ensure
compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct. We will also continue to work with our suppliers to assist them
in identifying any areas of risk in their own supply chains and to mitigate the risk of modern slavery occurring.
Contracts and Procurement
Our contractual and procurement approach has always been to try and include relevant and binding provisions
in our key external supply contracts to ensure our suppliers and our partners trade ethically and take
appropriate steps to ensure there is no slavery or trafficking in their business. These protections will continue to
be included in all key external supply contracts going forwards. We have also updated the language in our
supply contracts to ensure that third parties warrant their compliance to the Act in all dealings with or on behalf
of LFC and to increase the robustness of LFC’s audit rights in respect of our supply contracts so if we suspect
or have reason to suspect non-compliance, we can act swiftly and accordingly.
Training and Awareness
In order to ensure that our key staff understand and are aware of the risks of modern slavery and human
trafficking and can assist us in preventing this, both in our business and in our supply chain and the businesses
of our partners, we continue to provide training to representatives from our board of directors, management
team, HR team and procurement team.
LFC will continue to take specialist legal advice to ensure it is informed of any updates or changes to its
obligations under the Act.
LFC remains committed to upholding human rights and safety in our supply chain and we will be reviewing our
progress and effectiveness in combatting slavery and human trafficking on an annual basis.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Act and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking
statement for the financial year ending 31 May 2019.

Refusing to be an accessory to any form of slavery or human trafficking and in accordance with the California Transparency in
Supply Chains Act, Cummins Allison is adopting a zero tolerance approach towards slavery and human trafficking in its supply
chains:

Verification of product supply chains
Cummins Allison archives the statements on human trafficking / slavery it receives from its suppliers for new components used
in its products.

Audits of suppliers
Cummins Allison has not identified significant risks with direct suppliers that would require the conduct of supplier audits.

Certifications from direct suppliers
For any component used in the manufacture of its products, Cummins Allison systematically asks its suppliers to provide a
statement of compliance to applicable slavery and human trafficking laws.

Internal accountability
Each Cummins Allison employee and consultant agrees to fulfill their assigned tasks in accordance with applicable laws and the
principle of respecting human rights. In the event Cummins Allison becomes aware of a violation, management will take the
appropriate measures, which can extend to the dismissal of the employee.

Training
Cummins Allison informs and trains those employees and managers that have a direct role in supply chain management. The
objective is to develop awareness and understanding of the issues of human trafficking and slavery in supply chains and to
ensure that verification of the supply chains is done in accordance with Cummins Allison's procedures.

Conflict Minerals Policy Statement
In July 2010, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law, also known as the Dodd-Frank Act (the
""Act""). Although the focus of the Act is financial market regulatory reforms, it also imposes requirements relating to ""Conflict
Minerals"". Specifically, section 1502 of the Act imposes Security and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") reporting requirements upon
publicly-traded companies whose products contain metals derived from minerals defined as ""Conflict Minerals"". ""Conflict
Minerals"" refers to specific mineral ores and their derivatives (gold, tantalum, tin, and tungsten) which originate from Democratic
Republic of the Congo (""DRC"") or specified adjoining countries.
The new reporting requirements reflect Congressional concern that revenues obtained from mining and transport of ""Conflict
Minerals"" finance the ongoing conflict in the DRC and surrounding countries and the resulting humanitarian crisis.
Cummins Allison, as a privately held corporation, is not subject to the Conflict Minerals reporting requirements; however, as a
supplier to publicly-traded companies, we are committed to helping our customers comply with their reporting requirements. In
addition, Cummins Allison is fully supportive of global industry efforts to ensure responsible manufacturing processes with
transparent sourcing in full accordance with the law.
The Act requires publicly-traded companies to report annually to the SEC on (a) their worldwide use of ""Conflict Minerals"" in
products they manufacture or contract to manufacture, and (b) the cooperation of their supply chains in identifying the use of
""Conflict Minerals""; identifying the country of origin for any tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold; and determining whether ""Conflict
Minerals"" from the DRC region are ""conflict free"" (that is, they do not directly or indirectly finance armed groups through mining
or mineral trading in the DRC Region).
Supplier cooperation will be needed to get information from smelters/refiners (the choke points in identifying the source of the
minerals) in their supply chain as to whether products contain ""Conflict Minerals"" that originate in the DRC or adjacent countries.
Note that these requirements will apply equally to U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers.
Annual submissions to the SEC will under certain circumstances require an independent, third-party audit, and therefore proper
documentation of information related to your supply chain is critical.
Just as Cummins Allison is doing, it is important that our suppliers examine their supply chain and consult with their suppliers to
verify that no ""Conflict Minerals"" are included in any of their products. Working together is the only approach that will enable
everyone subject to these requirements to accomplish this task.

Modern Slavery Act Statement 2018/2019

This statement is made in accordance with the Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act
2015 (MSA 2015).
Modern slavery is the illegal exploitation of people for personal or commercial gain, often in
horrendous conditions from which the victim cannot escape. Businesses have a key part to
play in the effort to tackle this crime and protect vulnerable workers from exploitation.
Stebbings Car Centre Limited (SCC) has a zero tolerance approach to modern slavery and
is committed to ensuring that it is not taking place within its business or supply chains.
SCC is the largest used car dealership in East Anglia and operates from a single site in
Kings Lynn. Its principle activity is the sale of used vehicles and also arranges finance to
enable customers to buy the vehicles. SCC (inc GMS) employs over 50 employees directly
and also works with a variety of suppliers to provide a wide range of goods and services.
SCC main protection against modern slavery is to ensure that all business activities comply
with minimum wage legislation and the same is expected of its suppliers. In addition SCC
ensures that all people employed, directly and indirectly, have the right to work in the UK and
appropriate checks are carried out by the HR department. To ensure external supply chains
comply with this policy, SCC requires that business practices of each supplier are in
accordance with MSA 2015 and monitors compliance by suitable levels of due diligence
according to the level of risk of the potential for human trafficking and/or modern slavery.
The main area of risk within SCC/GMS’s supply chains are the use of temporary workers,
however with the above due diligence and regular monitoring, will ensure this risk is
minimised.
Any instances of non-compliance of which SCC/GMS’s is made aware, will be assessed on
a case-by-case basis. Remedial action will be taken and tailored to suit the circumstances.
The ultimate sanction for continued failure to comply will be for SCC to cease to trade with
that supplier.
SCC operates a number of policies and procedures to prevent exploitation and human
trafficking, which includes but is not limited to:
✓ Recruitment – including right to work checks, contracts of employments and ensuring
everyone employed is 16 and above
✓ Equality and Diversity – creating an inclusive working environment free from
discrimination and harassment and ensuring equality of opportunity
✓ Whistle Blowing – ensuring staff are aware they can raise concerns confidentially
including suspicions relating to modern slavery
✓ Grievance procedure – providing a fair and transparent process for all employees to
raise serious concerns regarding their employment.

SCC believes all employees have responsibilities to ensure our fellow workers are
safeguarded, treated fairly and with dignity. A clearly defined Modern Slavery Policy has
been developed and communicated to all colleagues within the business to ensure
compliance and awareness at all levels. All employees involved in the recruitment and
management of employees are also trained in Equality and Diversity and fair recruitment
practices. Ultimate responsibility for defining and implementing policies and procedures lies
with the HR team and ensures that everything implemented acts in accordance with current
legislation, including modern slavery. The HR team is suitably trained on modern slavery,
including the necessary steps to be taken if suspicions are raised within its business and/or
supply chains.

Modern Slavery Act
MODERN SLAVERY ACT 2015 - STATEMENT 2019
(covering the period 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019)

INTRODUCTION
ConvaTec aims to operate at all times with the highest standards of integrity. Doing what is right and
challenging what feels wrong no matter what the issue or circumstance are part of our core values.
We are committed to preventing slavery and human traf cking and implement policies and
processes to prevent, assess, detect and report violations within our own operations and our supply
chains. This statement which is published in accordance with section 54 (1) of the Modern Slavery Act
2015 outlines our approach during the period 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019.

OUR BUSINESS AND STRUCTURE
We have a clear vision – pioneering trusted medical solutions to improve the lives we touch. This
statement, which encapsulates our purpose and our ambition, is at the heart of everything we do.
This vision, and the following values, determine how we run our business every day.
Improve care: We are passionate about serving and supporting people with deeply personal
and challenging medical conditions. We actively listen and respond to their needs: demonstrating
deep empathy and using the insight we gain to develop and share innovative solutions.
Deliver results: We consistently deliver excellent work, say what we do and do what we say. We
focus on what matters to the people we serve, ful lling our own roles while working in a team with
shared goals. We keep things simple and strip out complexity wherever possible.
Own it: We take personal ownership of all our work: taking the initiative, innovating, taking
smart risks and never settling for second best. We are bold but humble, manage ambiguity and
move quickly to seize opportunities or adjust to new demands.
Grow together: We help colleagues around us grow, develop and thrive, so we can all ful l our
potential and make ConvaTec a “destination employer”. We respect what each of us contributes to
ConvaTec: inspiring and supporting each other to excel, while sharing in our successes and
learning from mistakes. We are candid, constructive and committed to collaboration with
colleagues and partners.
Do what’s right: We are honest and trustworthy, meeting our obligations and operating with
the highest standards of integrity. We challenge what feels wrong: no matter what the issue or



circumstances. We seek advice and input from others when in doubt. We embrace responsibility
(/country(/)make a positive economic,
for our contribution to local communities and
environmental and social
selector/)
impact on society.



How we run our business in a responsible way is summarised in our 2019 Corporate Responsibility
Report which can be viewed here (https://www.convatecgroup.com/corporateresponsibility/corporate-responsibility-reports/).
We are focused on the chronic care market, with established positions in advanced wound care,
ostomy care, continence and critical care and infusion care. We develop and manufacture innovative
products that give people living with chronic conditions con dence, freedom and mobility. We also
offer a range of services to support these people and the healthcare professionals who care for them.
We market and sell our products and services in over 110 countries and own and operate nine
manufacturing plants located in seven countries: the UK, three within the EU (Denmark, The
Netherlands and Slovakia) plus Belarus, the Dominican Republic and Mexico. Our reported revenue
for 2019 was $1,827m, split geographically as follows: Europe, Middle East & Africa ($724m – 40%),
Americas ($960m – 53%), and Asia Paci c ($139m – 8%). Our Group structure includes over 50 active
companies. This statement is relevant to all our active companies including the following three active
companies which are located in the UK: ConvaTec Group Plc, ConvaTec Limited and Amcare Limited.
Throughout 2019 we sold and marketed our products and services through the following four
franchises:
Advanced Wound Care (2019 revenue: $570m – 31%): advanced wound dressings and skin care
products for the management of acute and chronic wounds resulting from ongoing conditions
such as diabetes and acute conditions resulting from traumatic injury and burns.
Ostomy Care (2019 revenue: $525m – 29%): devices, accessories and services for individuals with
a stoma (a surgically-created opening where bodily waste is discharged), commonly resulting from
causes such as colorectal cancer, in ammatory bowel disease and bladder cancer.
Continence & Critical Care (2019 revenues: $457m – 25%): products and services for people with
urinary continence issues related to spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, spina bi da and other
causes, and devices and products used in intensive care units and hospital settings. The franchise
included the Home Services Group (HSG) through which we distribute disposable, intermittent
(single-use) urological catheters and ostomy products directly to patients in the U.S.A
Infusion Care (2019 revenue: $276m – 15%): disposable infusion sets for diabetes insulin pumps,
similar pumps used in continuous subcutaneous infusion treatments for conditions such as
Parkinson’s disease and a range of products for hospital and home healthcare markets.
To support our strategy to transform our business and pivot to sustainable and pro table growth,
during 2020 we will transition to a new organisational structure that will include six integrated global
business units: Advanced Wound Care, Ostomy Care, Continence Care, Infusion Care, Emerging
Markets and Home Services Group.
Further information about our business, markets, products and nancial performance is included in
our 2019 Annual Report and Accounts which can be viewed here

OUR SUPPLY CHAINS

(/)

 (/country- 
selector/)

Our supply chains include companies based in all parts of the world, including but not limited to
China, Taiwan, U.K., U.S.A., Canada, Denmark, Slovakia, Belarus, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, France,
Ireland, Spain, Poland, Turkey, Russia, Germany, The Netherlands, Mexico and Dominican Republic.
Our suppliers provide raw materials (e.g. chemicals, adhesives, lms, PVC compounds etc.), part
nished products (e.g. moulded items), nished products (e.g. primary and secondary packaging),
services (e.g. sterilisation) and research and development support. Some elements of our supply are
concentrated with a small number of suppliers. For example, in 2019, approximately 70% of our
contract manufacture was with seven suppliers and two suppliers represented approximately 67% of
our logistics spend. Other categories are more evenly distributed, with 34 suppliers representing
approximately 80% of our raw material purchasing.

OUR POLICIES ON SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
We implement a number of policies and codes which are relevant to slavery, people traf cking, and
human rights and ethical behaviour more broadly. We publish these policies and codes on our
website and they can be viewed here.
Our Human Rights and Labour Standards Policy
(https://www.convatecgroup.com/media/1325/human-rights-and-labour-standards-policystatement_ nal.pdf) (“Policy”), which applies to our own operations and employees, speci cally
addresses the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the International Labour
Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the Ten Principles of
the United Nations Global Compact. The Policy clearly states that “ConvaTec does not accept nor

condone any form of modern slavery whether forced, compulsory or traf cked labour. Without
limitation, ConvaTec does not engage sweatshop labour, convict labour or indentured labour under
penal sanction.”
The Policy is referenced in our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct
(https://www.convatecgroup.com/corporate-responsibility/behaving-ethically-andtransparently/code-of-ethics-and-business-conduct/) (“Code”) which de nes out core principles of
good business practice and our standards for professional and personal behaviour. The Code includes
sections on human rights, discrimination and harassment.
Every ConvaTec employee is required to report any actual or potential violation of either the Policy or
the Code and communication channels are in place within the Group to facilitate and encourage
such reporting, including an independently-managed whistle-blowing hotline (see below).
Our Supplier Code of Conduct (https://www.convatecgroup.com/media/1298/supplier-code-ofconduct-19-august-2016.pdf)(“Supplier Code”) addresses issues of human rights and the prohibition
of child labour, compulsory labour and human traf cking. All new suppliers are required to sign our
Supplier Code, and since its publication in 2016, our existing suppliers are required to sign it as and
when their contracts are renewed.



We operate a cross-functional Human Rights Steering Committee that oversees policy matters
(/country(/) representatives from
relating to human rights. The committee includes
our Supply Chain, Supplier
selector/)
Quality, Legal, Corporate Responsibility and Human Resources teams.



In many countries we conduct our business via third party distributors. We evaluate third party
distributors prior to engagement and require that our distributors comply with all applicable laws
and regulations and our Global Third Party Compliance Manual
(https://www.convatecgroup.com/media/1229/convatec-global-third-party-compliance-manualenglish.pdf).
We regularly review our policies and codes which are relevant to slavery, people traf cking, and
human rights and ethical behaviour. In particular during 2020 we will review and update our human
rights-related policies, including our Policy and our Supplier Code.

RISK ASSESSMENT AND DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES FOR SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING
We believe the risk of slavery and traf cking in our own operations to be very low.
We evaluate our prospective suppliers using a business review process that focuses on the quality of
the product manufactured, the standard of documentation in place and other performance
indicators. We also carry out cyclical quality audits assessing compliance with relevant regulations. As
highlighted above all new suppliers receive and are required to sign our Supplier Code.
As part of our risk assessment process, in 2017 we conducted desk-top country studies of human
rights-related risks for four of our markets where we operate manufacturing plants. In addition, we
also monitor supplier status using the third-party risk platform, “Risk Methods”, which provides indepth, real-time coverage of a range of factors that could impact on supplier performance (geopolitical, climatic, civil unrest), as well as events that may have been “caused” by our suppliers (e.g.
strikes, major pollution incidents, human rights abuses reported in the media).
Currently risk is assessed supplier by supplier and by the end of 2019, we had not completed a full risk
assessment of slavery and traf cking across our supply chain.
Our approach to human rights within our own operations and within our supply chain is assessed
regularly by one of our key customers, the UK National Health Service (“NHS”), using its Labour
Standards Assurance System (“LSAS”) which outlines the principles and guidelines the NHS requires it
suppliers to comply with to ensure good labour standards are driven throughout its supply chain.
Assessments relate to particular product category tenders, and cover all the aspects of a
management system approach to human rights, including topics such as roles and responsibilities,
policy, communication and awareness, risk assessment, operational control and training.

SUPPLIER ADHERENCE TO OUR VALUES AND ETHICS
Within ConvaTec we evaluate and monitor our supplier relationships through a strategic partnership
made up of our Supply Chain, Supplier Quality, Legal, Corporate Responsibility and Human Resources
functions. This cross-functional team, which mirrors the composition of our Human Rights Steering



Committee (above), is tasked with developing and continuously improving how we evaluate and
(/) to our values and(/countrymonitor our suppliers and ensure their adherence
ethics.
selector/)
Currently we use the following mechanisms to evaluate our suppliers and ensure their adherence to



our values and ethics:
Third-party supplier assessment
To support our internal assessment of suppliers against our Supplier Code, we operate a process
managed by a third-party provider. This process includes an evidence-based assessment which
follows existing best practice and codes. Furthermore, it is based on a comprehensive set of ethics,
labour rights, health and safety, and environmental criteria which are closely aligned with our
Supplier Code. Each assessment is tailored to t the size, sector and geography of the individual
supplier and cover issues including: health and safety, working conditions, child and forced labour,
discrimination, energy and greenhouse gas emissions, water and waste management, use of
chemicals, local pollution, corruption and bribery, information management, and the supplier’s own
supply chain assessment processes.
Starting in mid-2017, an initial group of suppliers were selected to participate in this third party
managed assessment process. These suppliers were selected based on their scale, their strategic
importance to our business and the perceived risk associated with their products and services. In
total they represented approximately 75% of our 2017 total spend with contract manufacturers and
raw material and logistics suppliers.
This third party assessment process continues to be rolled out progressively across our supplier base
and all new major suppliers are strongly encouraged to participate. However as at 31 December 2019,
only 41% of the assessments had been completed. Recognising that the process is not functioning
effectively we are working to re-invigorate it. Further information about the steps we are taking is
provided in our 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report which can be viewed here
(https://www.convatecgroup.com/corporate-responsibility/corporate-responsibility-reports/).
Certi cation – Supplier Agreements
We require our direct suppliers to comply with the laws of the country in which they operate. To help
ensure our suppliers respect and enforce our standards with regard to anti-slavery and human
traf cking our template supplier agreement includes the following clause:

”Supplier represents, warrants and covenants that (i) it complies with all applicable laws on working
hours and employment rights in the countries in which it operates; (ii) the evaluation and treatment
of its employees and applicants for employment are free from discrimination and harassment,
whether such discrimination or harassment is based on sex, age, race, colour, ancestry, religion, belief,
disability, sexual orientation or marital status; (iii) the Products supplied under this Agreement shall
be manufactured under conditions in compliance with the principles set out in the International
Labour Organization Eight Fundamental Conventions nos. 29, 87, 98, 100, 105, 111, 138 and 182 and in
the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child Article 32; and (iv) no Products have been
made in whole or in part by sweatshop labour, convict labour or indentured labour under penal
sanction.“



This clause is included in all new supplier agreements and is being phased in to existing suppliers’
(/country(/)
agreements as and when their contracts are renewed.
selector/)
Audits



In accordance with our Supplier Code, we are entitled to perform various types of audit assessments
to verify the current state of supplier compliance and undertake routine monitoring of the supplier’s
on-going compliance. If a supplier fails to comply with our Supplier Code, we can either put in place a
remediation plan or, in cases of severe non-compliance, refuse to pursue or terminate an existing
relationship.
At the end of 2019, these processes did not reveal any issues that warrant an “onsite” audit focused on
traf cking and modern slavery to be conducted.
Open Communication and Whistleblowing
We are committed to fostering a work environment where open, honest communications are the
expectation, not the exception. We encourage our employees to approach their supervisor or
management in instances where they believe violations of policies or standards have occurred,
including in relation to traf cking or slavery issues. We also encourage them to ask if they require
guidance about any of our policies and procedures.
In situations where the employee prefers to place a report in con dence, we provide access to an
independent helpline, hosted by a third party hotline provider, EthicsPoint. This helpline is available in
all countries where we have a direct presence. Where there may be restrictions on con dential or
anonymous employee reporting, employees are directed to an internal con dential ConvaTec
resource to help review and resolve any reports of concern. This would include issues relating to
traf cking and slavery.
We also operate a Compliance Helpline which is accessible to our employees and any third party via
our website.
TRAINING
We provide mandatory training in relation to our Code for all new and existing employees on an
annual basis. This training is delivered through online training modules and assessments and via
“Town Hall” meetings and face-to-face sessions. As part of our management induction process new
members of our management team participate in training in relation to our Policy.
EFFECTIVENESS
We believe our policies, training and procedures are effective in reducing the risk of slavery and
human traf cking taking place within our own business. To date we have not received any reports of
these activities.
In relation to our supply chains, the audit assessment processes we operate have not revealed any
issues that warrant an “onsite” audit focused on traf cking and modern slavery to be conducted. As
highlighted above, we are taking steps to re-invigorate our existing third-party led supplier
assessment process. Despite the slower than hoped for progress, we have not received any reports of
slavery or people traf cking in our supply chain to date.



SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC ACTIONS TAKEN IN 2019
(/country(/)
All new and existing employees were provided with mandatory
training in relation to our Code.
selector/)



New members of management participated in training in relation to our Policy.
41% of suppliers invited to participate in the third party-managed assessment process had been
assessed. The third-party managed supplier assessment process was reviewed and actions were
agreed to re-invigorate its effectiveness.
We have continued to integrate consideration of performance in the assessment process
(above) into supplier scorecards, alongside measurement of factors such as quality, reliability and
value. The score from the assessment has been incorporated into the Supplier Relationship
Management scorecard in place for each supplier used as part of the overall supplier evaluation
process.
Suppliers continue to be required to sign, return and comply with the ConvaTec Supplier Code
of Conduct.
In 2019, in the UK, we have again been certi ed (by Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance) at Level 3
of the NHS LSAS (see above). We are working to achieve Level 4 – the highest level achievable
under the current framework.
Policies and codes relevant to slavery, people traf cking, and human rights and ethical
behaviour were reviewed and we agreed that during 2020 we will update our human rightsrelated policies, including our Policy and our Supplier Code.
This statement has been approved by the Board of Directors of ConvaTec Group Plc and is signed by
the director responsible for ensuring compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

Modern Slavery Act Statement 2018-2019
This statement is The Prince’s Trust’s voluntary modern slavery and human trafﬁcking statement
relating to section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (“the Act”).
We oppose slavery and human trafﬁcking in all its forms and make this statement to set out the
steps we have taken to ensure that slavery or human trafﬁcking is not taking place in our business or
in our supply chains.

About us
The Prince’s Trust is a company incorporated by Royal Charter and a registered charity in (1) England and
Wales and (2) Scotland. We work with young people in the United Kingdom to develop the conﬁdence to
live, to learn and to earn. Much of our support for young people is delivered through partner organisations
and with the aid of volunteers. We also work with a diverse range of sponsors, funders and suppliers who
will have their own suppliers, sub-contractors and partners.
The Prince’s Trust Group includes the work of The Prince’s Trust, together with a network of other
organisations carrying out work in other countries:
 Prince’s Trust International (PTI)
 Prince’s Trust Canada (PTC)
 Prince’s Trust Australia (PTA)
 Prince’s Trust New Zealand (PTNZ)
 Prince’s Trust America (PTAm)
The Prince’s Trust is the sole member of PTI, PTC, PTA and PTAm, and is the sole settlor of the PTNZ trust.
The Prince’s Trust’s commercial activities are dealt with by its wholly owned subsidiary, Prince’s Trust
Trading Limited , a UK registered company.
None of the entities in The Prince’s Trust Group (whether separately or combined) have an annual turnover
of £36 million from the provision of goods and services (as set out in the Act). Therefore, although we are
not required to make a modern slavery statement under the Act, The Prince’s Trust is choosing to
voluntarily comply as we believe it is incumbent upon all organisations to do what they can to tackle
modern slavery and human trafﬁcking. This statement is intended to show our commitment to ethical
trading principles and to set out the steps we are taking in our business and in our supply chains. In
relation to overseas entities, we have set out our expectation that they procure goods and services in a
transparent way, having regard to the Act.
We have assessed the main relevant areas of The Prince’s Trust’s business as follows:
 Procurement of goods and services to support our operations, including contract cleaning
services, merchandise, ofﬁce supplies and equipment, travel services, and IT delivery and support.
This would also cover the use and recruitment of agency workers, temporary workers and
consultants.

 Use of delivery partners to carry out our programmes, particularly in relation to programmes where
programme participants may obtain temporary or permanent employment as a result of their
participation.

Our policies
We have a number of policies in place to assist us in our in ensuring compliance with the Act:
 Whistleblowing Policy;
 Anti-bribery Policy;
 Fraud and Theft Policy;
 Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorism Policy;
 Ethical Fundraising Policy, which includes due diligence requirements on organisations/individuals;
 Procurement Policy, to ensure that appropriate due diligence is undertaken and contract wording
is included for suppliers, and
 Safeguarding Policy, which sets out standards for our staff and procedures regarding reporting of
suspected abuse.

Our actions
We are committed to ensuring that value for money does not compromise our obligations or our
commitment to the Act. Our commitment to the eradication of modern slavery is shown in a number of
actions which are undertaken by us:
 Risk management plays a key part in the identiﬁcation, management and escalation of risks within
the supply chain. This process enables the Boards of the Group entities to evaluate compliance
with the Act within each entity.
 The policies listed above have all been updated or introduced in the last year. They are scheduled
for review at least every two years, to ensure they are up to date and relevant to the work that we
do.
 We have amended our template contracts with partners carrying out our programmes to include
wording regarding modern slavery.
 We have carried out an initial review of what we expect of suppliers relating to our operations (eg
contract cleaning, ofﬁce and IT suppliers), and have standard wording setting out our standards and
expectations. We have contacted the main organisations who we procure marketing or
merchandise goods or services from, particularly those with onward supply chains, and ensured
that variation letters are signed where existing contracts do not contain appropriate wording
regarding modern slavery.
 We carry out appropriate due diligence (in line with our Ethical Fundraising Policy) on those
organisations/individuals who wish to fundraise with or for us.
For work carried out by Prince’s Trust International, we have a due diligence process for the appointment
of new delivery partners and when scoping new countries or territories.

Ongoing work
We intend to take the following further steps to combat slavery and human trafﬁcking:
 We will carry on our work to review our contract arrangements with programme partners to ensure
that any new or renewed contracts contain appropriate wording regarding modern slavery.
 We will continue to increase our safeguards in our supply chains. Initial work will focus on those

suppliers where we assess there is the greatest potential risk.
 We will ensure that recruitment agencies on our preferred supplier list are reputable agencies –
and require that all those on our preferred supplier list have appropriate modern slavery provisions.
 We will continue to review our behavioural framework for staff and ensure that there are clear
mechanisms in place to signpost staff and volunteers to additional policies and resources.

Effectiveness in combatting slavery and human trafﬁcking
We will continue to keep our effectiveness under review and to make changes to our operations and our
ongoing work if they are not proving to be as effective as they ought to be.

Training
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafﬁcking in our supply
chains and our business, we recognise the importance of staff training. In spring 2018 all staff were
required to complete mandatory safeguarding training, which included a section on child trafﬁcking. This
training is also mandatory for all new staff. Over the next year we will continue to seek improvements to
training processes for staff and volunteers, including widening the scope of training to include modern
slavery as well as child trafﬁcking.
This voluntary slavery and human trafﬁcking statement is made in connection with section 54(1) of the
Modern Slavery Act 2015, for the ﬁnancial year ending 31 March 2019. It was approved by The Prince’s Trust
Council on 21 March 2019.

Cambridge Meridian Academies Trust (CMAT) is required to publish an annual Modern Slavery
Statement to satisfy the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. This will be published
on the CMAT website and updated each year. This will take place in March of each year.
1. Introduction
Modern slavery is a crime resulting in abhorrent abuse and violation of human rights. It takes
many forms, which include slavery, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking. CMAT
will not condone or engage with any provider of goods or services, where we believe there
may be a risk of slavery or human trafficking. CMAT is committed to undertaking the
appropriate actions to minimise the risks with the Trust and our supply chains.

2. About CMAT
We are a multi-academy trust, committed to providing high quality and dynamic education for
everyone, right in the heart of our community and that desire has grown into the Cambridge
Meridian Academies Trust (CMAT). As at February 2019 CMAT comprised of 5 Primary
schools and 7 Secondary schools.
The Trust started life as Cambridge Meridian Education Trust (CMET) which was incorporated
in March 2009 in order to enter the competition to promote the new schools at Northstowe a
new town proposed between Swavesey and Cambridge. It was founded by those who already
were passionate about education in the area – the governors and trustees of Swavesey Village
College; an outstandingly successful and innovative school.
In March 2011 CMET became Cambridge Meridian Academies Trust (CMAT), a multi-academy
trust, this enabled Swavesey Village College to convert to academy status, sponsor other
academies, and help spread good education practice.
Our academies have common values and core operational systems, which are applied locally,
adapted to individual context and needs. By this simple expedient each academy retains their
own local governing bodies, identity and individuality. The young adults who leave our care are

prepared for the next stage of their education and are ready and confident to move forward in
life.

3. Risk Management
Risk management forms part of the day to day operation of CMAT. Trustees, the Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) and Senior leaders of CMAT have formally identified, and documented
the major risks to which CMAT is exposed. These risks have been reviewed by the Trust,
Finance, Personnel, Estates and Audit Committees, and appropriate risk management strategies
are in place. CMAT are regularly audited by external and internal auditors, who carryout
robust testing of internal controls and report back to the CEO.
The priority for CMAT is the protection of pupils and employees. This will always be identified
as an area of risk. The trust has robust policies and procedures in place to minimise any
potential risks, which are reviewed annually and cascaded to all employees.

4. Child Protection and Safeguarding Policy
CMAT is committed to providing a safe and secure environment for pupils, staff and visitors.
CMAT has Safeguarding and Child Protection policies in place, which focus on pupils feeling safe
within the school environment. It is essential that we promote a climate where pupils and
adults feel confident about sharing any concerns that they may have about their own safety or
the wellbeing of others. Our school Child Protection policies are based on the Department for
Education publication: Keeping children safe in education, September 2018, and all employees
are required to read and understand this document.
All schools, normally under the remit of the Principal and Designated Safeguarding Lead ensure
that staff and Academy Councilors undertake safeguarding and child protection training once a
year and keep up to date with information in relation to neglect and abuse. CMAT will produce
resources for schools to utilise and enhance staff awareness of modern slavery. Persistent child
absences are investigated and followed up.
CMAT employs Safeguarding leads as part of the Core Trust. These leads undertake
Governance and safeguarding checks and report back to the CEO and relevant committees.

5. HR Policies
Recruitment - CMAT is committed to safe recruitment processes. All staff recruited to work
in one of the trust’s academies will be subject to the rigorous recruitment procedures as
outlined the Keeping Children Safe in Education document 2018. All senior leaders and
managers are encouraged to attend the safer recruitment training course. The importance of
safeguarding and protecting children attending our academies is promoted as much as possible

throughout the recruitment process to help deter, reject or identify people who might abuse
children. CMAT are reviewing the ways in which safeguarding questions are more relevant and
testing to the situation. CMAT undertakes all relevant statutory vetting checks including
criminal record checks (DBS checks), barred list checks and prohibition checks together with
right to work and references. We also ensure that any contractors of services to our schools
provide assurances that they have also carried the safer recruitment checks.
Whistleblowing policy - CMAT has in place a Whistleblowing Policy, aimed principally at our
employees. The Whistleblowing Policy places a duty on all our employees to report misdoings
and improper conduct. CMAT is committed to ensuring that all concerns raised under the
Whistleblowing policy are fully investigated and appropriate action taken if required.
6. Procurement
A significant proportion of our procurement is with suppliers who are appointed through means
of a tender process. CMAT have identified that some of our procurement takes place within
sectors where modern slavery offences could occur, such as within our catering supply chains,
uniform supply, cleaning supply chains and the construction industry. During 20 19/2020 CMAT
are committed to:
• setting up trust wide procurement contracts for all schools, whereby the necessary
checks will have already been assessed.
• Include compliance with the Modern Slavery Act as a condition or criterion in
specification and tender documents wherever possible. The contractor may be required
to include equivalent clauses in their own contracts with sub-contractors
(where permitted) with the aim of enabling enforcement higher up the supply chain.

This document was approved by the Chair of the Board of Trustees'

Introduction
Marlborough College is committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking in its corporate
activities and to ensuring that its supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking. This
statement sets out the steps Marlborough College has taken during the financial year 1st July 2017
to 31st August 2018 (Please note that a change to financial year-end implemented in the academic
year 2017/18 provides for a one time only fourteen-month accounting period). These steps are
being taken to understand potential modern slavery risks within its business and to ensure that
there is no slavery or human trafficking taking place in its business and supply chains.
Organisation Structure and supply chains
Marlborough College is one of the country’s leading co-educational boarding schools. Founded
in 1843, it is a vibrant community of over 950 pupils, nearly all of whom board: sixteen Boarding
Houses offer excellent accommodation and the College houses many of its teachers.
Marlborough believes firmly in its duty to offer a balanced and broad education, based upon ideals
of rigour, respect and responsibility. It is an Anglican foundation with a rich heritage of strong
academic leadership. The College is a major local employer: the Common Room consists of over
150 teachers and there are more than 500 supporting staff.
In 2012, Marlborough College Malaysia opened and currently has over 900 pupils from over 40
different nations.
As Marlborough College is a charity, procurement of quality goods and services has always been
an important part of ensuring charitable funds are carefully spent. Supply chains utilised by
Marlborough College currently include uniform, catering, maintenance, grounds and gardens,
cleaning, furniture and equipment, stationery and ICT hardware.
Marlborough College has considered which of its supply chains could be at a high risk of slavery
or human trafficking. Regard was given to supply chains which are high risk, originate outside
the UK and guidance from ISBA (The Independent School Bursars Association) which identifies
high risk supply chains for schools as catering, stationery and uniform.
Due Diligence
As part of Marlborough College’s initiative to identify and mitigate the risk of slavery and human
trafficking in supply chains, Marlborough College carries out stringent due diligence on new
suppliers. This includes:
Obtaining general information on supplier companies and understanding their corporate
structure
Modern Slavery Statement 2019

Assessing suppliers financial stability by reviewing recent and previous company accounts
Ensuring suppliers are able to provide adequate assurances of their own commitment to
preventing modern slavery and human trafficking through their recruitment and remuneration
policies
Ensuring suppliers are able to provide relevant health and safety checks
Ensuring suppliers on Marlborough College framework contracts are ISO 9001 compliant and
provide details of their quality assurance systems and policies across a number of areas – this is
to ensure high standards particularly in relation to working conditions and people
Obtaining details of supplier policies for the purchase of consumables
Relevant Policies
Marlborough College has an Anti-Slavery policy, which demonstrates its commitment to act
ethically and with integrity in business relationships. The policy also demonstrates Marlborough
College’s commitment to having effective systems in place to ensure slavery and human
trafficking are not taking place within its business and its supply chains.
Marlborough College’s Anti-Slavery policy refers to their relevant and long standing
Marlborough College polices including:
Code of Conduct
Whistleblowing
Equality and Diversity
Bullying and Harassment
Recruitment, Selection and Disclosure
Disciplinary
These policies are all carefully monitored and reviewed on a regular basis.
Marlborough College is confident that together these policies effectively mitigate the risk of
slavery and human trafficking taking place within its business or supply chains and provide
support to staff should they have any concerns.
Marlborough College’s Anti-Slavery policy will be reviewed annually and supplemented with
details of additional steps that can be taken by staff to ensure there is no slavery or human
trafficking in Marlborough College’s business of supply chains
Further steps and Key Performance Indicators
Marlborough College is committed to improving its practices to ensure that its business and
supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking. Some of the additional steps that
Marlborough College will consider implementing in future are:
Enhanced due diligence specific to slavery and human trafficking
Enhanced due diligence on existing suppliers rather than on new suppliers only

ANTI-SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATEMENT
Financial year ending 30 April 2019

CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S STATEMENT
This statement is made in accordance with section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and
constitutes Gateley (Holdings) Plc's slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial
year commencing 1 May 2018 and ending 30 April 2019. This statement covers the activities
of Gateley (Holdings) Plc and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as follows: Gateley Pic, Entrust
Limited, International Investment Services Limited, Kiddy &Partners Limited, Gateley Capitus
Limited and Gateley Hamer Limited. References to ""Gateley"", ""we"", ""us"", ""our"" or the
""company"" are to Gateley (Holdings) Pic and the members of its group.

GATELEY(HOLDINGS) PLC
Gateley (Holdings) Plc is the English holding company of a group of companies providing legal
and other professional services. The group has an annual turnover in excess of £36 million
with both the company and Gateley Plc individually having turnovers in excess of this amount.
Gateley employs over 900 people, predominantly professionally qualified and highly skilled
people, across offices in England, Northern Ireland, Ireland and Dubai. To find out more about
the nature of our business, please click http://gateleyplc.com/about-us/.
Gateley is opposed to slavery and human trafficking and is committed to preventing it from
occurring within its business and supply chain. We expect our suppliers to be similarly
opposed to slavery and human trafficking.
Due to the nature of the services we provide and the jurisdictions in which we provide those
services, we consider the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring within our business to
be low.
As providers of legal and other professional services, we work with a range of suppliers who
provide products and services to support our business ranging from office consumables, to
technology, to other professional services. We like to work closely with our suppliers and
have many long term supplier relationships. However, we do not consider that we are
dependent upon any particular supplier.
All references in this statement to policies and systems in place are relevant to all of the
companies constituting the Gateley group.
POLICIES
As part of our commitment to combating slavery and human trafficking we have adopted a
specific anti-slavery policy which has been approved by our Board of Directors.

4.

DUE DILIGENCE, RISK AND COMPLIANCE
As part of our efforts to monitor and reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring
within our supply chains, we have adopted procedures to identify slavery and human
trafficking risks associated with our suppliers.
Our procedures are designed to:
•

establish and assess areas of potential risk in our business and supply chains;

•

monitor potential risk areas in our business and supply chains;

•

reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our business and
supply chains; and

•

provide adequate protection for whistle blowers.

We do not consider that we operate in high risk sectors or locations because we provide
professional services and our offices and clients are predominantly based in the UK.
Gateley evaluates the nature and extent of its exposure to the risk of slavery and human
trafficking occurring in its supply chain by assessing the risk relating to its suppliers. Factors
that are considered when undertaking a risk assessment include the origin of manufacture and
supply and the nature of, and location from which, services are provided. Depending upon the
level of risk identified, we may undertake due diligence with our supplier or proposed supplier
to enable us to assess the situation in more detail.

This Modern Slavery and Human Trafﬁcking Statement sets down our commitment to working
towards preventing slavery and human trafﬁcking in our business activities, and the steps we have
put in place and continue to develop, with the aim of ensuring that there is no slavery or human
trafﬁcking in our own business and supply chains.
We all have a duty to be alert to risks, however small. Staff are expected to report their concerns
and management to act upon them. As part of the supply chain, we undertake due diligence to
ensure we are not entering into a contract or services that could be misconstrued and demand of
our suppliers the highest credentials. This also includes any agencies that supply our companies
with temporary labour.
We undertake company checks and satisfy ourselves of the viability of the company we do
business with. We would also take account of any Foreign Ofﬁce advice relating to countries we
provide services to. The following activities are considered to be at high risk of modern slavery or
human trafﬁcking:
Employment of foreign nationals who are not permitted to work in the UK and vehicles or
those of our suppliers crossing UK borders.
Responsibility for our anti-slavery initiatives are as follows:
Policies Human Resources in each business unit are responsible for creating and reviewing
policies. The process by which policies are developed is to review best practice and
legislation and adapt policy to the needs of the organisation.
Risk assessments The Compliance Manager and Health & Safety and Process Manager is
responsible for risk assessments in respect of human rights and modern slavery by a process
of planned review, audit and control activities.
Due diligence Human Resources and Finance departments, along with the Compliance
Manager and Health & Safety and Process Manager are responsible for due diligence in
relation to known or suspected instances of modern slavery and human trafﬁcking.
To ensure a good understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafﬁcking in our
business and supply chains, the organisation requires all relevant staff to undertake online
awareness training in Modern Slavery and Human Trafﬁcking. The organisation operates the
following policies that describes its approach to the identiﬁcation of modern slavery risks and steps
to be taken to prevent slavery and human trafﬁcking in its operations:
Whistleblowing policy – The organisation encourages all its workers, customers and other
business partners to report any concerns related to the direct activities, or the supply chains
of, the organisation. This includes any circumstances that may give rise to an enhanced risk
of slavery or human trafﬁcking. The organisation’s whistleblowing procedure is designed to
make it easy for workers to make disclosures, without fear of retaliation. Employees,
customers or others who have concerns can complete our conﬁdential disclosure form
Employee code of conduct – The organisation’s code contained in employee handbooks
makes clear to employees the actions and behaviour expected of them when representing the

organisation. The organisation strives to maintain the highest standards of employee conduct
and ethical behaviour when managing its supply chain
Supplier/Procurement code of conduct – The organisation is committed to ensuring that its
suppliers adhere to the highest standards of ethics. Suppliers are required to demonstrate
that they provide safe working conditions where necessary, treat workers with dignity and
respect, and act ethically and within the law in their use of labour. We work with suppliers to
ensure that they meet the standards of the code and improve their worker’s working
conditions. However, serious violations of the organisation’s supplier code of conduct will lead
to the termination of the business relationship
Recruitment policy – The organisation uses only speciﬁed, reputable employment agencies to
source labour and always veriﬁes the practices of any new agency it is using before
accepting workers from that agency. We regularly audit employment agencies we use to
ensure that all right to work and identity checks are being carried out
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Policy – The organisation’s CSR policy summarises how
we manage our environmental impacts and how we work responsibly with suppliers and local
communities
Performance indicators The Group uses the following key performance indicators (KPIs) to
measure how effective we are in ensuring slavery and human trafﬁcking is not taking place in any
part of our business or supply chains: The use of labour monitoring and payroll systems; Outcomes
of employment agency auditing process; Annual risk assessment data; Number of complaints
raised.
As part of the supply chain we undertake due diligence to ensure we are not entering into a
contract or services that could be misconstrued and demand of our suppliers the highest
credentials. This also includes any agencies that supply the group with temporary labour. All Board
members of the group and Directors of the trading businesses are committed to ensure that there
isn’t any modern slavery or human trafﬁcking in our supply chains, by auditing and choosing world
brand leaders in delivery. Our Anti-slavery policy reﬂects our commitment to act ethically and with
the utmost integrity in all our business relationships. We work to ensure our suppliers adhere to our
policies and when correct to do so back to back our employment criteria ensure the best in class
systems and controls are used. With the issuance of strict, moral codes and practices to our
partners, we regularly carry out audits through our internal and HR departments, assisting to drive
out all aspects of human trafﬁcking and slavery from our supply chains. Education is key to the
understanding and the upholding of these policies and as part of our management toolkits, we
actively ask all management and our employees to raise concern if they believe any aspect of our
supply chain is compromised by human trafﬁcking or slavery.
The Delivery group and its companies undertake rigorous internal veriﬁcation of employees, with
interviews, work histories, CRB checks, right to work checking and professional screening to
reduce the risk of employing a person that is not registered or allowed to work in the constituent
supply chain. These policies must also be able to be audited with all our temporary labour
suppliers (Agencies and Gang masters), ensuring against legislative compliance breaches. The
Board of Directors absolutely believe that with driving the correct internal and supplier behaviours,
slavery in any form will be removed from day to day life. It is a basic prerequisite that we remove
any instance across our supply chain, and therefore have accordingly, have approved this
statement and that of the modern slavery act. The above statements are made at this time and will
be reviewed annually or indeed when a change of legislation means it is relevant and proper to do
so.

MODERN SLAVERY ACT STATEMENT

Modern Slavery Statement 2019
We are committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain and our corporate activities.
We pride ourselves in acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships and expect
the same high standards from our contractors, suppliers, customers and other business partners.
Our Business
Highland Spring Limited is a privately owned bottled water business established in 1979, with 4 operational
bottling plants, each with their own natural water sources, and provides employment to around 400 employees.
Responsibilities
The Chief Executive and Group Management Team are responsible for ensuring the statement is up to date and
accurately reflects the Company’s actions and initiatives to tackle slavery and human trafficking.
HR and all Functional Heads are responsible for introducing polices and reviewing the process by which they are
adopted.
Our workers are encouraged to report any concerns they may have, and management are required to act upon

them.
Due Diligence
We are committed to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to prevent the risk of slavery
and human trafficking in our supply chains. Steps taken to date include:
·

Membership of the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (SEDEX), a not for profit membership organisation

dedicated to driving improvements in responsible and ethical business practices in global supply chains.
· Working to maintain compliance with the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) Base Code of Conduct and
undertaking regular auditing across the relevant operational sites.
·

When recruiting, we adopt good practice approaches to identification and reference checking. As standard,

we require our agency providers to do likewise. Regular audits are then carried out to assess and monitor
compliance.
·

Anti-slavery and human trafficking obligations are included as part of our standard raw material and

packaging supplier contractual documents.
·

Operating a formal supplier approval process across our packaging, raw materials and warehousing supplier

base which incorporates:
Ø monitoring SEDEX membership status of our suppliers;
Ø understanding the ethical policy status of our suppliers; and
Ø as part of the continual review of our supplier approval process, SEDEX membership has become an essential
requirement for all existing and new packaging and raw materials suppliers.
Policies
The requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 are reflected within our policies and procedures. We have
developed a Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy, and operate the following compliance policies: AntiBribery, Bullying and Harassment, Whistleblowing and Ethical.
We will implement additional policies and related measures where appropriate to support our commitment to
preventing slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains.
Training and Awareness
We provide training regarding slavery and human trafficking for senior management and all members of our
Supply Chain, Procurement and HR Teams to ensure they understand the risk and provide guidance on how to
report and manage any concerns. Our Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy is published on our
employee intranet and we will ensure continuing employee awareness through appropriate communications. We
support the Stronger Together UK initiative and ensure appropriate representation at relevant workshops.
Performance Measures
Whilst we do not have any designated key performance indicators against slavery and human trafficking, our

systems and controls regarding supplier screening and auditing allow us to periodically assess relevant policies are
being adhered to. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our processes and take the necessary steps

SECTION 172 STATEMENT
The revised UK Corporate Governance Code (‘2018 Code’) was published in July
2018 and applies to accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The
Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 (‘2018 MRR’) require directors
to explain how they considered the interests of key stakeholders and the broader
matters set out in section 172(1) (A) to (F) of the Companies Act 2006 (‘S172’) when
performing their duty to promote the success of the Company under S172. This
includes considering the interest of other stakeholders which will have an impact
on the long-term success of the company. The board welcomes the direction of
the UK Financial Reporting Council (the ‘FRC’). This S172 statement, which is
reported for the rst time, explains how the directors:
have engaged with employees, suppliers, customers and others; and
have had regard to employee interests, the need to foster the company’s business
relationships with suppliers, customers and other, and the effect of that regards,
including on the principal decisions taken by the company during the financial year.
The S172 statement focuses on matters of strategic importance, and the level of
information disclosed is consistent with the size and the complexity of the business.
When making decisions, each Director ensures that he/she acts in the way he/she
considers, in good faith, would most likely promote the Company’s success for the
bene t of its members as a whole, and in doing so have regard (among other
matters) to:
S172(1) (A) “The likely consequences of any decision in the long term”:
The company’s operations, including it’s sales, manufacturing and investment plans
for the year, are set out through the annual budget. This is prepared by the
company’s senior leadership team and approved by the board of the ultimate
parent company and is aligned with the long-term plans for the Site within the
context of the overall group strategy.
In addition to reporting on the nancials through the monthly management
accounts, the board of directors is kept informed of operational matters through
monthly reports compiled by the senior leadership team. This report includes, but
is not limited to, manufacturing performance, safety statistics and quality metrics.
The board takes a view on long-term decisions based on commercial enquiries,
research and development activities and thereafter the appropriate nancial and
analytical modelling, which it receives in the form of detailed proposals presented
by the senior leadership team to the board and subsequently to the ultimate

parent company. This could include, but not be limited to, new product
development, acquisition opportunities and strategic partnerships.
S172(1) (B) “The interests of the company’s employees”:
The directors recognise that the companies employees are fundamental and core
to our business and delivery of our strategic ambitions. The success of our
business depends on attracting, retaining and motivating employees. From ensuring
that we remain a responsible employer, from pay and bene ts to our health, safety
and workplace environment, the directors factor the implications of decisions on
employees and the wider workforce, where relevant and feasible.
The board of directors support signi cant levels of investment in training, online
learning, paid-for external development, and the hosting of internal learning events.
This sits alongside a generous bene ts package which includes pension
contributions above the statutory minimum requirement and an annual bonus
scheme.
The board of directors recognises the importance of having a diverse workforce
that both re ects the company’s global supply chain network, and which
strengthens its business growth. The business is committed to promoting fairness
and equality in the workplace which it demonstrates through a number of policies,
including: Equal Opportunities Policy; Flexible Working Policy; Parental Leave Policy;
and Maternity, Paternity and Adoption Policies.
S172(1) (C) “The need to foster the company’s business relationships with
suppliers, customers and others”:
Delivering our strategy requires strong mutually bene cial relationships with
suppliers, customers, local and national government, regulators and other
associated stakeholders.
Moreover, the directors receive information updates on a variety of topics that
indicate and inform how these stakeholders have been engaged. These range from
information provided from the supply chain function (on suppliers related to items
such as sourcing project updates and supplier contract management topics) to
information provided by the commercial and development teams (on customers
related to items such as business strategies, on-going manufacturing campaigns
and investment or divestment proposals).
In its relationship with suppliers, the company strives to maintain a reputation for
fairness and high standards through striving for contracts that provide mutual
bene t, and ensuring that suppliers are paid on time.
The company has a zero-tolerance to human tra cking and slavery and expects its
suppliers to take the same approach. The board of directors has approved the
publication of the company’s Modern Slavery Act statement and will support the
senior leadership team in its review of its policies and procedures to ensure
continued compliance.
In its relationship with customers, feedback can be collated by the several teams
and fed back to the directors, mainly by the Commercial Directors, whose primary
focus is customer engagement, management and communication. Speci cally with
regard to contract manufacturing agreements, our customers have a direct
contribution toward the supply chain, technical development and quality parameters

of our nished products, integration of customer feedback is a key input for our
site operations.
S172(1) (D) “The impact of the company’s operations on the community and the
environment”:
The directors recognise that the business has a signi cant responsibility when it
comes to its relationship with the environment. The site is Top-Tier COMAH (Seveso
III) compliant, has a broad environmental permit and similarly has extensive
consents in place to allow us to handle a broad range of substances at a range of
scales. A key consideration for the business in this respect is with regards to its
chemical substance waste management. The site has direct pipeline access to one
of the largest municipal liquid aqueous waste disposal facilities in Europe, and
works closely with its sister company Fine Environmental Services Limited, who
operate one of only three, third party licensed, high temperature thermal oxidisers
for incineration of other waste streams. The business continues to work with its
regulators in maintaining compliance and striving for best practice where
environmental impact is concerned.
S172(1) (E) “The desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high
standards of business conduct”:
The directors recognise that the business operates within an industry where a high
degree of emphasis is placed on ensuring business decisions are economically,
environmentally and socially responsible. The company periodically reviews its
policies and principles, as set out in the company Sta Handbook and other
guiding documentation, to ensure that these high standards are maintained. This,
complemented by the ways the board is informed and monitors compliance with
relevant governance standards help assure its decisions are taken and that the
company acts in a way that promotes high standards of business conduct.
S172(1) (F) “The need to act fairly as between members of the company”:
The directors consider which course of action best enables delivery of our strategy
through the long-term, taking into consideration the impact on stakeholders. In
doing so, our directors act fairly as between the Company’s members but are not
required to balance the Company’s interest with those of other stakeholders, and
this can sometimes mean that certain stakeholder interests may not be fully
aligned.

Supplier code of conduct
Fine Organics’ is committed to ensuring that our suppliers adhere to the highest
standards of ethics. Suppliers are required to demonstrate that they provide safe
working conditions where necessary, treat workers with dignity and respect, and act
ethically and within the law in their use of labour. We work with our suppliers to

diligence and reviews include:
1. mapping the supply chain broadly to assess a particular product or geographical risks
of modern slavery and human trafficking;
2. evaluating modern slavery and human trafficking risks of each new supplier as part of
our assessment.
Over the next few years we will;
1. Conduct supplier audits or assessments where we have assessed the need for a
greater degree of focus on slavery and human trafficking;
2. Participate in industry appropriate collaborative initiatives focused on human rights in
general, and slavery and human trafficking in particular;
3. Assess whether ethical supplier databases could be used to strengthen our
compliance,
4. Invoke sanctions against suppliers that fail to improve their performance in line with an
action plan or seriously violate our supplier code of conduct, including the termination of
the business relationship.

Below is an archive of Cubico’s Modern Slavery Statements from 2016 to 2018.

Modern Slavery Statement Financial Year 2018
STATEMENT UNDER S.54 OF THE MODERN SLAVERY ACT 2015

1. Introduction
This is a statement made by Cubico in accordance with section 54 of the Modern Slavery
Act 2015 and covers the financial year from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018.

2. Background
Cubico is one of the world’s leaders in providing renewable energy, the fastest-growth
energy source, across the Americas and Europe. Our portfolio includes onshore wind,
solar photovoltaic and solar thermal assets.
We are fully committed to playing a significant role in the transition towards a clean energy
world optimizing the use of natural resources while respecting the environment and the
social development of the communities in which we are present.
Our organisation is split broadly between corporate activities and operational activities.
Corporate Activities
Our corporate activities are performed at the following offices: London (where we are
headquartered), Uxbridge (UK), Madrid (Spain), Milan (Italy), Lyon (France), Sydney
(Australia), Mexico City (Mexico), Stamford (USA), São Paulo (Brazil). Although not
operational in the financial year in question, we do now also have offices in Uruguay and
Colombia. Employees in these offices undertake skilled activities including project

origination and execution and corporate services (finance, tax, legal, HR). We also have an
office in Fortaleza (Brazil) where both corporate activities (providing legal, technical and
finance/accounting support to the Brazilian projects) and operational activities (providing
day-to-day operational support to the Brazilian projects) are undertaken.
Our corporate activities have only an occasional dependence on temporary workers and
contractors and the nature of that work is mainly of a professional service nature.
Operational Activities
Our operational activities constitute the building and management of our renewable energy
assets ‘on the ground’. We predominantly outsource the construction of new assets to
contractor(s) experienced in these areas. Once our assets are in service, we
predominantly outsource the operation and maintenance work. Our asset management
services, which include providing support and resources to the relevant project companies
to enable effective supervision and monitoring of the assets and oversight of contractors,
and to provide certain corporate, legal and other back-office services are partially
outsourced. All outsourced construction, operation and maintenance and asset
management activities are managed through contracts with the various third parties in
commercially agreed forms and are generally on a medium or long term basis.

3. Slavery and trafficking policies
Operating to high ethical standards is central to our organisation. Both our General Code
of Conduct and our Anti-bribery and Corruption Policy make clear that good corporate
governance and the professional ethics of our employees are the pillars upon which
Cubico’s activity is based.
We welcome the increased focus brought to bear by the United Kingdom’s Modern Slavery
Act 2015 and the Legal and Compliance team have responsibility for implementing and
reviewing controls to address the risks of modern slavery occurring in our operations and
supply chains.

Building on the work we did during 2017 to update policies and make more explicit
reference in them to modern slavery, during 2018 we identified that we could:
increase the clarity of our approach to the need to assess whether suppliers, joint
venture partners, sellers, developers, acquisition targets and other stakeholders with
whom we engage (together referred to as “Third Parties”) maintain appropriate
standards with respect to the prevention of modern slavery in their own operations
and supply chains; and
make the tools available to employees to address those risks more readily and easily
accessible;
by combining our separate Procurement Policy and KYC Business Partnering Vetting
Guidelines into one unified policy. We now have a single Cubico Procurement & Business
Partner Vetting Policy to which our employees can turn for guidance.
We continue to commission KYC Reports at certain key points in our relationships with
Third Parties that are categorised as medium or high risk. These reports incorporate an
assessment of the risks of modern slavery. During the course of 2018 no KYC Reports
were generated which raised specific concerns with respect to modern slavery.
During 2017 we introduced a Supplier Code of Conduct which sets out the standards we
expect from all those who work for and with us with respect to combating modern slavery,
anti-bribery and corruption and health and safety standards. We continue to place a
contractual obligation on all medium and high risk Third Parties to adhere to our Supplier
Code of Conduct.

4. Risk assessment
Corporate Activities

We have assessed that, given our internal operating standards, the risk of modern slavery
occurring in our corporate activities is relatively low. However, we remain vigilant to the
risks particularly with respect to the limited low skilled outsourced labour that we engage at
our offices (e.g. cleaning services).
Operational Activities
We have also assessed the risks of modern slavery occurring in our operational activities
and identified key areas of focus to be:
Our high-risk jurisdictions: Cubico has a global footprint and operates in a number of
jurisdictions. Some of those jurisdiction pose a higher risk than others and are
monitored more closely as a result.
The high levels of outsourcing of operational activities (as described above): Whilst
Cubico predominantly contracts with large, well established suppliers we
acknowledge that even they do not always have their own directly employed local
work forces in the remote locations of some of our projects.
The nature of the work undertaken, including:
construction of assets and the infrastructure that supports them;
outsourcing of operation and management activities associated with finished
assets; and
outsourcing of low skilled maintenance work at assets, particularly in higher risk
jurisdictions.
Slavery and trafficking risks are already taken into account in the assessments made when
Cubico is deciding whether to acquire or develop assets in a new country. The Legal and
Compliance team have a central role in advising the organisation on those risks.
Legal Risk and Compliance Health Check – Anti-bribery & Corruption and Modern Slavery

During 2018 we carried out an assessment of our risks with respect to (i) bribery and
corruption and (ii) modern slavery in conjunction with 22 internal stakeholders across
our operations in Mexico, Brazil, Italy and Spain. As a result of that review we:
created the single, unified Cubico Procurement & Business Partner Vetting Policy
referenced above; and
began a process of issuing questionnaires to our high and medium risk suppliers in
these jurisdictions.
Assessment of the responses to questionnaires received to date have not highlighted the
need for further action to be taken or investigations made. However, during 2019 we will
continue to follow up with suppliers who have yet to respond and will continue to risk
assess the information received and any ongoing failure to respond.

5. Due diligence and actions to address risks
Our procurement practices and controls (which include insisting on a contractual right to
audit a supplier where appropriate) have mitigated the risks of modern slavery in our
organisation and supply chains. However, the increased focus that we have placed on
modern slavery (as described above), particularly with respect to our procurement
practices, further enhances our risk management.
At the start of 2018 we appointed a Global Health and Safety Manager who regularly
undertakes site visits. He has undergone modern slavery training and assesses our risks in
this area when on site which enhances our risk management practices and controls.
During 2018 he did not identify any areas of specific concern which required further action
or investigation with respect to modern slavery. However, he did find that a supplier in
Mexico was engaging in poor work practices (relating to 12 hour shifts) with respect to a
small number of security guards. We worked with that supplier to ensure that those
working conditions were improved.

6. Our proposals for 2019 and beyond

We are committed to combating the risks of modern slavery occurring within our
organisation and supply chains. Cubico’s Internal Auditor and Procurement Manager
alongside the Legal and Compliance team, have specific remit to further address the risks
and will lead initiatives to:
follow up with Third Parties that have not returned slavery and trafficking
questionnaires and assess the responses to develop our risk analysis and selection of
suppliers;
via site visits conducted by our Global Health and Safety Manager, continue to carry
out due diligence and audits on suppliers and our own assets. Our Global Health and
Safety Manager will be visiting our recently acquired operations in Colombia before
the end of 2019 and we will consider issuing modern slavery questionnaires and
carrying our further due diligence on the operations there;
enforce the requirements of the Supplier Code of Conduct which we introduced during
the course of 2017;
liaise directly with our Global Health and Safety Manager on issues/risks he identifies
and make recommendations to Cubico’s Legal and Compliance team.
Modern slavery will continue to be a standing agenda point in respect of all quarterly risk
management meetings which are attended by all heads of country.

7. Training
As noted in our 2016 statement we acknowledge that our employees are our ‘eyes and
ears’ when it comes to vigilance on the risks of modern slavery. In 2018 we invested in an
e-learning modern slavery module which was rolled out to approximately 50 employees in
our procurement, operations, asset management, health and safety and legal functions
and to our Country Leads. Where appropriate new staff will also be required to undertake
this training.

This statement is made by Cubico Sustainable Investments Limited and the board of
directors of the company have approved it and will update it annually.

Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2018

Modern Slavery isa criminal offence under the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015. It
can occur in various forms including servitude, forced or compulsory labour
and human trafficking, all of which include the deprivation of an adult or child’s
liberty by another, collectively called Modern Slavery. Over 40 million people
live in some form of Modern Slavery worldwide according to the International
Labour Organization (ILO), 25 million of them are victims of forced labour. These
inhumane practices should not be tolerated or assisted. Companies can play
a major role in preventing Modern Slavery by firmly implementing human rights
for all workers along their whole supply chain.

Risk Assessment.

Panasonic is aware that the risk of Modern

Slavery occurring is higher in some regions than in others. This does not mean
we neglect our work in the less affected areas, but we prioritise our action
towards regions associated with a high risk. The majority of our suppliers as
well as our business operations are located in Asia. According to the ILO, in
Asia and the Pacific region four out of every 1,000 people were victims of
forced labour in 2016, therefore we recognise this region is of special
attention to us.
Some circumstances present greater opportunities for Modern Slavery to
take place, one of them being the exploitation of foreign migrant workers,

3

•

jF . ii

In the context of modern slavery, the following human rights and labour
violations are likely to occur:

Payment below minimum wage
Passport
confiscation

Threat of keeping wage as penalty for
not complying with orders

Restricted and short bfeaks

Recruitment fee

Long working
hours

Restriction of freedom of
movement in and after
work hours

Conflict with working
contract

According to the ILO, half of all victims of forced labour are in some kind of
debt bondage to their employers or recruitment agencies which makes it
impossible for them to leave their job.
We at Panasonic do our best to prevent any of these incidents from
happening in our business or supply chain. To know the risks to which foreign
migrant workers especially are exposed, and which are possible to occur in
our supply chain, helps us to keep an eye on our suppliers in regard to any
of the violations as listed above.

Our Policies.

Our stance against Modern Slavery works alongside our

policies to ensure a responsible supply chain. Panasonic has various
procedures in place helping us to identify and mitigate risks as well as verifying
the absence of Modern Slavery in our supply chain.
Our most important policy is the Panasonic Code of Conduct. It includes
requirements to create a working environment defined by respect and human
rights for all Panasonic employees. Furthermore, it states that Panasonic will not
employ people against their will. To us. our goal is that not only everyone
working for Panasonic but also those whose work relates to our company has
reod the Code of Conduct and acts according to its requirements.
Complementing our Code of Conduct is the Global Human Rights and Labour
Policy. Both cover issues such as working hours, wages, humane treatment,
prohibition of discrimination, protection of privacy, concern for the human
rights of foreign workers, trainees, and younger labourers, the freedom of
association and more. This way we ensure that our business activities contribute
to a respectful environment where all employees are treated rightfully.

Due Diligence.

In our business and supply chain we strive for a

continuous process of tracking and assessing the ongoing performance of our
suppliers regarding human rights and labour issues. In a very dynamic and
volatile environment it is important to reassess possible risks and respond to
changes.
We expect all members of our supply chain, as well as contractors, to comply
with our Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking policy, our business principles and
Basic Business Philosophy. They should also understand our position on CSR
related topics, including safeguarding human rights and the health and safety
of workers, and the Panasonic Group issued Supply Chain CSR Promotion
Guidelines. These Procurement Guidelines have been created in Japanese,
English and Chinese. We expect our suppliers to adhere to these guidelines
and therefore we are working on distributing them to all our suppliers via email
and ensuring that they have been notified of our expectations. To ensure our
values are implemented across the whole supply chain, our operations follow
the official Panasonic Procurement Policy. The fundamental basis of this policy
is the concept that, based on relationships of mutual trust, and through diligent
study and cooperation, our suppliers are invaluable partners in creating the
value our customers demand.
When starting business with new suppliers and setting up the supply contract,
it is of great importance to include clauses on Anti-Slavery and Human
Trafficking in our standard purchase agreements. Panasonic is therefore
committed, overtime, to include these clauses in all our purchasing contracts.
Within these clauses, suppliers are also expected to comply with our Anti
slavery policy and to provide evidence of their compliance when requested.

•

:

Employees, as well as suppliers, should understand and follow our values and
principles. For that reason we conduct training for all new, permanent staff on
our Basic Business Philosophy and Code of Conduct. This includes face to face
as well as online training on the following topics: compliance with local laws,
respect for basic human rights with emphasis on not employing persons
against their will, and on compliance with local employment laws.
We protect whistle blowers by providing an anonymous whistle-blowing
hotline for employees which is run by an independent third party.
Employees are regularly reminded of the whistle-blowing hotline and are
encouraged to use it if they suspect any potentially illegal behaviour or
practice.

Panasonic

Following our statement last year, Panasonic Corporation’s Global
Procurement Team has been conducting CSR self-assessments with its
suppliers. The CSR sell-assessments fully cover issues related to Modern
Slavery. In FY2017, the Panasonic Global Procurement Team conducted
CSR self-assessments with around 2,000 suppliers mainly in Japan. Where
concern is raised in the responses obtained, further contact is made, with
some investigations conducted through site visits. Identified risks are
discussed with the supplier and Panasonic assists in formulating a corrective
action plan where required. In FY2O1 7, we examined conditions on the
ground at 7 of our suppliers in Thailand and China. We identified issues in
areas such as health & safety and environment, and we have requested
the suppliers in question to rectify these issues.
When recruiting employees, Panasonic adopts a perspective of protecting
fundamental human rights and engages in recruitment activities that comply
with the laws and regulations of the respective countries in which we operate.
Panasonic prohibits forced labour including child labour. In order to prevent
child labour, we have included age verification in the CSR sell-assessment
which is used when individuals join the company. The company does not
allow employees under the age of 18 to engage in overtime work and heavy
labour, and offers them consideration and support including, as appropriate,
the opportunity to receive education.

Follow—up.

In the Slavery and Human Trafficking statement from last
year we announced plans for future work for the coming years under 4
headings:
Supplier CSR meeting and self-check questionnaire
Follow-up of the self-check questionnaire
Hotlines for workers employed by suppliers
Employ an external information service
While good progress has been made on the first two subjects as already
detailed above, slower progress has been made on the last two.
However the challenge to tackle Modern Slavery is a dynamic process that
does not always follow a straight line. Having been made aware through the
media of certain working conditions for employees in our supply chain in recent
years. we appreciate the need to maintain a process of continual
improvement in these risk areas. Panasonic is committed to bring increasing
transparency to our supply chain to help ensure workers’ protection. We will
continue to put our effort into the elimination of situations that allow any form
of Modern Slavery to arise in our supply chain.

Modern Slavery Statement 2017/18
1. Introduction and Structure
The Wrekin Housing Group (‘the Group’) is a Community Benefit Society registered with the Financial
Conduct Authority under the Co-operative & Community Benefit Society Act 2014. Our main business
is the provision of social housing, care and support, adding social value to the lives of the people who
receive our services and live in our communities.
The Wrekin Housing Group has three subsidiaries – Choices Housing Association, a care provider;
Old Park Services – a trading subsidiary; and Strata Housing Services – a development subsidiary.
The Group is regulated by the Regulator of Social Housing, with Choices Housing Association
regulated by the Care Quality Commission.
This statement covers the Group and its subsidiaries for the financial year ended March 2018.
•

The Wrekin Housing Group is one of the largest social housing providers in the West Midlands,
with over 13,000 homes for rent and shared ownership across Shropshire and Staffordshire.
We provide affordable homes for single people, couples and families. Working with various
community groups in these areas, we help to build and support local communities.

•

Choices Housing Association is a not-for-profit supported housing and care organisation, the
principal activity being the provision of housing, care and support services for older people and
individuals with learning and/or other disabilities. We offer a range of housing options and support
services to meet the needs of individuals who want to live independently, bringing care where
it’s needed to enhance quality of life and enable individuals to live the life they want, in their own
home and communities.

•

Through Strata Housing Services, our significant development programme provides added
benefits beyond providing homes. These include job and apprenticeship opportunities, support to
local businesses and economic growth.

•

Old Park Services carries out trading activities and this includes maintenance, ICT, personal
alarm equipment, upcycling and selling pre-used furniture and other goods through social
enterprise - Reviive. Old Park Services also manages and lets market rented properties.

2. Statement
As a business we are committed to upholding the highest standards of probity, openness and
transparency so we can provide the best service to our customers. We are committed to preventing
the existence of slavery and human trafficking within our business and supply chains, we are and will
continue to address the issue with appropriate urgency and seriousness, devoting senior management
time and resources to meet our obligations and good practices. We expect those we work with to have
the same approach and we would not work with any organisation whose approach or practices are
incompatible with our own.
We recognise that there is potential for our service users, tenants and leaseholders to be affected
by modern slavery. We have policies and procedures in place to ensure that employees are vigilant
to the risks for those who are vulnerable within our sector and business, for example, through the
Safeguarding Policy and the Homecheck Policy. Through our Corporate Social Responsibility
Policy, Procurement Strategy and Code of Conduct we demonstrate our commitment to
respecting human rights and operating in an ethical way with integrity. We strive to work with partner
organisations to prevent and detect modern slavery. Our business is in the early stages of tackling the
issue comprehensively and the implementation of our Modern Slavery Policy and twelve month action
plan, led by the Group Board and Executive Team, will demonstrate our zero tolerance approach.

Modern Slavery Statement 2017/18
3. Supply Chains and due diligence
Our key area of risk lies in our relationships with supply chains – suppliers, contractors and business
partners. We are committed to ensuring that our supply chains are clear to expose evidence of slavery
and human trafficking. Our goods and services are from UK based suppliers although supply chains
are global and we recognise that no supply chain can be entirely free from the potential of slavery or
human trafficking. We have an expectation that those in our supply chain and those who contract with
us comply with our values and our pre-qualification questionnaires determine the suitability of potential
suppliers. All new and existing suppliers are being asked to provide evidence of how they mitigate
the risk of modern slavery in their business and in their supply chains. They are also being asked to
declare that they have not been involved in modern slavery and human trafficking offences.

4. Employment
We recognise that there is potential for employees to be affected by modern slavery and human
trafficking. We have robust policies and procedures in place which are regularly audited to ensure
compliance with employment legislation.
We encourage employees to report any concerns relating to business activities. Our Whistle-blowing
Policy makes it easy for employees to raise concerns in confidence.
Recruitment processes include the verification of identity and the right to work in the UK. Given the
nature of the care sector, there is a need to employ temporary staff and this is a potential area of risk
as we do not have full control over the recruitment process.

5. Training for Staff
The Executive and Senior Management Team consider where the risk of modern slavery or human
trafficking may arise in their parts of the business and ensure that their teams are aware of this risk.
This year we are providing training to employees on Vulnerability & Exploitation and the Modern
Slavery Awareness Handbook (Home Office publication) has been published on our intranet for staff to
help them recognise the signs.
This statement is made under section 54 (1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and will be
reviewed and updated on an annual basis.

Our Processes for Managing Risk
In order to assess the risk of modern slavery, we use the following processes with our suppliers:


We review the potential for risk at regular intervals, including the possibility of re-auditing a supplier
or conducting spot checks.

After due consideration, we have not identified any significant risks of modern slavery, forced labour, or
human trafficking in our supply chain. However, we continue to be alert to the potential for problems
Additionally, we have taken the following steps to minimise the possibility of any problems:


We reserve the right to conduct spot-checks of the businesses who supply us, in order to investigate
any complaints.



We require the businesses we work with to address modern slavery concerns in their policies



We collaborate with our suppliers in order to improve standards and transparency across our supply
chain.



Only senior members of staff who have undergone appropriate training for assessing modern slavery
risks in the supply chain are authorised to sign contracts and establish commercial relationships in
any area where we have identified the potential for risk.



We ensure that all of our suppliers are members of appropriate industry bodies and working groups.

Our staff are encouraged to bring any concerns they have to the attention of management.
4

Our Performance
Based on the potential risks we have identified, we have also established the following key performance
indicators, which are regularly assessed by our senior leadership team:


the percentage of workers supplied from our preferred supplier list



the effectiveness of enforcement against suppliers who breach policies



the amount of time spent on audits, re-audits, spot checks, and related due diligence



the level of modern slavery training and awareness amongst our staff

We carefully consider our indicators, in order to ensure that we do not put undue pressure on our suppliers
that might increase the potential for risk.
5

Our Training
All of our staff receive training and support that is appropriate to their role. In particular:


All of our staff receive awareness-raising information around issues involving modern slavery and
human trafficking, so that they can bring any concerns they have to the attention of management.

This statement is published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out the steps the Company has taken to prevent slavery
and human trafficking taking place in our business or in our supply chains.
Modern slavery has no place in our business or our supply chains and S&A takes a zero tolerance approach to it. Whilst recognising that
modern slavery affects every economy and can take many forms, including forced labour, child labour, human trafficking and bonded labour,
we are strongly committed to playing our part in eradicating modern slavery and recognise the importance of Transparency in Supply Chains
in driving collaborative action to help eliminate the incidence of modern slavery.

“We will play a leadership role within our industry in promoting the dignity of the people who grow, harvest
and pack the fresh produce we sell. Those who work in our business (UK and International) and our global
supply chain will be recruited and employed responsibly”…John Davies, Director & Founder.
Our Business
S&A is the UK’s largest independent Strawberry grower. It is also a global
business with its own growing operations and partnerships with growers
around the world, importing and packing high quality fresh berries for the
UK retail market. Our fruit is grown on our own farms or sourced globally
from partner growers who share our values and passion for quality
produce.
To prevent modern slavery in our business or our supply chains, we need
to make our own Directors and employees aware of the issues and provide
them with the tools to tackle it.
S&A provide regular training for all Directors and employees, to help them
understand the commitments and obligations of our business and how
they can help to ensure modern slavery is not part of our business or our
supply chains.
We also have the following polices in relation to slavery and human
trafficking:
• Preventing Hidden Labour Exploitation
• Anti-bribery policy and procedure
• Dignity at work policy
• Disclosures in the public interest (whistleblowing) policy
• Equal Opportunities Policy
• Ethical Trading Policy and procedure
• Seasonal workers reemployment Policy and procedure
• Induction Policy and Procedure
• Proof of eligibility to work in the UK procedure
• Staff Charter

HRP-087- Version 1
Page 1 of 1

These policies define our commitment to the upholding of
human rights and fair labour by setting out the minimum
standards that we expect to be adhered to. They are
regularly reviewed to ensure that they are in line with
statutory declarations such as the UN Universal Declaration
of Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation
(ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at
Work. We also integrate best practice expectations from the
Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) from
whom we regularly receive updates.
In addition, S&A has a long history of working with Stronger
Together, an initiative that aims to reduce human trafficking,
forced labour and exploitation of workers for the prevention
of modern slavery. S&A is also a member of Sedex (a not-forprofit membership organisation dedicated to driving
improvements in global supply chains).
Maintaining an ethical supply chain
S&A like many international suppliers understand that the
greatest risk of modern slavery is through our supply chains.
To mitigate this risk, S&A’s approach to tackling modern
slavery is based on a collaborative approach that focuses
where possible on building long term relationships that help
to develop greater transparency for us and those we work
with.

S&A uses a tiered approach with its supply chains:
• One to one communication – Our Commercial and Technical teams
have regular communication and work closely in partnership with
our suppliers and growers to ensure our operations remain free from
modern slavery.
•

•

Face to Face - we visit our suppliers and growers, to see first-hand
how their businesses are operating. We also conduct ethical audits
to the ETi base code and to provide additional support or guidance if
required.
3rd Party Verification – additionally we arrange bi-annual
unannounced independent ethical audits to the ETi base code, for
those countries that have been risk assessed and considered high or
medium risk, to provide another level of transparency to our supply
chain and assist us in driving further improvements collaboratively
with our suppliers and growers.

We work with our suppliers and growers on a basis of continuous
improvement to resolve issues. When an issue is identified, the type of
corrective action implemented will depend on a number of factors. These
include the severity of the issue and the willingness of the supplier or
grower to work jointly towards a solution. Sensitivity of the situation and
welfare for the persons involved will always remain a priority when
agreeing a solution. If a severe risk or issue is not resolved satisfactorily,
we will stop working with the supplier or grower in question. The
relationship will only resume once we are satisfied that the issues have
been fully resolved.
In our own business
S&A has received on-site verification of their ETI base code conformance
through independent, third-party Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audits
that are semi announced. The third-party audits follow version 5.0
December 2014 two pillar audit up to and including April 2017 and version
6.0 thereafter, which includes an assessment of Labour Standards, Health
and Safety, Environment and business ethics.
S&A recognise that there is a risk of slavery and human trafficking taking
place within its Seasonal Recruitment Process. We have taken a variety of
actions to verify the absence of forced, child, or bonded labour and human
trafficking in any part of its own business, including the following:

2. S&A does not allow finders fees to be paid by job
applicants. The Company does not use any individual
or organisation to source and supply workers without
confirming that workers are not being charged a work
finding fee.
3. All staff responsible for directly recruiting workers
were aware of issues around third party labour
exploitation and signs to look for and have signed
form HRF-038 Recruiter Compliance Principles.
4. Labour sourcing, recruitment and worker placement
processes are under the control of trusted and
competent staff members with a clear hierarchy and
areas of responsibility.
5. Take a proactive approach to reporting suspicions of
hidden worker exploitation to the Gangmasters
Licensing Authority and police.
6. Provided information on tackling “Hidden Labour
Exploitation” to our workforce through workplace
posters & worker leaflets.
7. Encouraged workers to report cases of hidden third
party labour exploitation provided the means to do so
and investigated and acted on reports appropriately.
8. Positively encouraged and supported employees and
agency workers to report such exploitation which
may be occurring within their communities through
our report mechanisms (Seasonal Liaison Officer,
whistleblowing service, comments box). All reports
are investigated in full and remedial action is taken as
appropriate. Importantly the whistleblowing hotline
is independently run and is a multi-lingual facility.
The whistleblowing telephone hotline service is
available 24/7 as is the internet reporting service and
callers can choose to disclose their details or remain
anonymous.

1. Designated managers who have attended “Tackling Hidden Labour
Exploitation” training and have responsibility for developing and
operating company procedures relevant to this issue.

9. Conduct a monthly audit of personnel records identifying any
duplicate home addresses, bank accounts, phone numbers
emergency contact numbers and next of kin as alert flags that may
indicate potential worker exploitation. Any suspicious duplicates
(i.e. not joint accounts for two

related workers) are fully investigated and remedial
action is taken as appropriate, with the view such

Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
1. Introduction
This statement, made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, sets out Lyons Davidson Limited (LDL)’s
actions to understand potential modern slavery risks related to its business and to put in place steps aimed at ensuring that
there is no slavery or human trafficking in its own business and its supply chains. This statement relates to actions and
activities during the financial year 2017/2018.
As part of the legal sector, LDL recognises that it has a responsibility to take a robust approach to slavery and human
trafficking. LDL is committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking in its corporate activities, and to ensuring that
those in its supply chains, and contractors, are free from slavery and human trafficking and comply with our values.

2. Organisational structure and supply chains
This policy covers the activities of LDL/Lyons Davidson Scotland LLP and File Dynamics Limited.
LDL is a law firm providing legal services to businesses and individuals nationwide. File Dynamics Limited provides support
functions to the business. LDL operates from eight locations in England and Wales together with its associated practice in
Scotland. Our supply chain comprises suppliers as expected in the running of a legal services office: including experts
instructed to provide advice to our clients; counsel; facilities services; recruitment agencies; training providers and
equipment providers.
The company currently only operates in the UK and has an annual turnover in excess of £36m.

3. Risk Assessment Process
Annually the company will undertake a risk assessment to determine the level of risk, relevant to our business and across our
supply chain, from modern slavery and human trafficking.
Any risks identified from the above process will be prioritised and dealt with in accordance with comments set out below.

4. High-risk activities
LDL does not believe it has any particular activities or is involved with any countries which are high risk in relation to slavery
or human trafficking.

5. Responsibility
Responsibility for LDL’s anti-slavery initiatives is as follows:
Overall: LDL Board;
Policies: HR department;
Risk assessment and due diligence: Compliance Director;
Training: Training department.

6. Relevant policies and initiatives
LDL operates the following policies that describe its approach to the identification of modern slavery risks and steps to be
taken to prevent slavery and human trafficking in its operations:
Whistleblowing policy: LDL encourages all its staff, clients and other business partners to report any concerns related
to the direct activities, or the supply chains of, LDL. This includes any circumstances that may give rise to an enhanced
risk of slavery or human trafficking. LDL’s whistleblowing procedure is designed to make it easy for staff to make
disclosures, without fear of retaliation. Employees, clients or others who have concerns can raise these with us at any

time;
Employee code of conduct: LDL’s code makes clear to employees the actions and behaviour expected of them when
representing LDL. LDL strives to maintain the highest standards of employee conduct and ethical behaviour when
operating abroad and managing its supply chain;
Corporate Social Responsibility programme: This documents LDL’s approach to its responsibilities in relation to
social, ethical and environmental issues. It deals with the way in which LDL aims to limit any adverse impact caused by
LDL’s business in these areas, and to promote a responsible approach in the way it conducts business, which includes
preventing slavery and human trafficking in its operations.

7. Due diligence
LDL undertakes due diligence when considering taking on new suppliers, and when reviewing existing suppliers, including:
Assessing particular product or geographical risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in respect of each supplier;
As part of contract negotiations/tender processes with any new supplier, considering whether they are required to
produce a Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement, and reviewing any such statement and associated
policies;
Evaluating the modern slavery and human trafficking risks of each new supplier;
Addressing any high-risk areas identified with the suppliers;
Taking steps to improve any suppliers’ practices which cause concern, including requiring them to implement action
plans;
Where a potential frequent supplier is unwilling to co-operate with our enquiries consider if that is a business
relationship we wish to start;
Invoking sanctions against suppliers that fail to address any identified issues, including terminating any relationship.

8. Performance indicators
In order to assess the effectiveness of our approach to modern slavery, LDL will be reviewing on an annual basis the following
areas:
Training for staff;
Staff awareness;
Reviewing existing supply chains; and
Developing a new suppliers’ evaluation process.

9. Training
LDL will require all those involved in supply chain contracting and management to complete training on LDL’s policy and
approach to slavery and human trafficking in order to better understand and respond to identified slavery and human
trafficking risks.

10. Awareness-raising programme
As well as training staff, LDL will raise awareness of modern slavery issues to all staff via our intranet explaining:
The basic principles of the Modern Slavery Act 2015;
How employers can identify and prevent slavery and human trafficking;
What employees can do to flag up potential slavery or human trafficking issues to the relevant parties within the
company; and
What external help is available.

11. Board approval
This policy has been approved by the company’s board of directors, who will review and update it annually.

Care for the seas and oceans from which
we source and support the people and
communities who rely upon them.
Our mission is to
challenge the status quo,
improve value, quality
and ethical standards
in seafood.
Currently our focus is on;
• Sourcing responsibly.
• Promoting and supporting
ethical behaviours for
the people in our
supply chain.
• Working legally and
safely.
• Operating with
minimal environmental
impact.

Our raw material supply chains
operate across a number of
different countries. We have
approximately 240 direct
suppliers across all our raw
material and other operational
procurement. We recognise
that many of our suppliers
have suppliers, both material
and labour. Our work has
continued to focus on our
direct suppliers over the last
12 months.
Modern slavery is an umbrella
term used to describe offences
of human trafficking, slavery,
forced labour and domestic
servitude. It also covers

Our Partners;

slavery-like practices such
as debt bondage, sale or
exploitation of children and
forced or servile marriage.
All these examples involve
one person depriving another
person of their liberty, in
order to exploit them for
personal or commercial gain.

Organisational
Policies
The company has the following policies in place to offer guidance to stakeholders
and to mitigate the risk of modern slavery;

Forced, Bonded and Involuntary Labour.
Freedom of Association.
Young Workers.
Recruitment Policy.
Grievance Policy.
Anti-Bribery Policy.
Whistleblowing Policy.
Equal Opportunities Policy.

We take any allegations that
human rights might have not
been upheld properly with the
utmost importance. We have a
whistleblowing policy to give
our employees in Whitby and
Kilkeel the tools to report
anything they feel is not
right within our business.
We have incorporated the
whistleblowing requirements
of our customers into our
sites where applicable.

As such the company is
committed to following
the principles of the
Ethical Trade Initiative
(ETI)
base
code
and
communicating this to our
employees. In 2018 we
started to encourage our
highest risk land based

operations to demonstrate
to us that they have applied
the ETI base code within
their operations.
This continued in 2019
as we continue to drive a
reduction in our supply
risk.

We believe that fair and
ethical
treatment
of
employees and workers is
fundamental to our success.

Risk Assessment
Whitby Seafoods employs risk assessment
methodology to identify where priorities for
further consideration should be taken.
The risk assessment takes into
consideration the jurisdiction
country for the catch area as
well as the country the fish
preparation takes place.
Seafish Social Risk Factors
in Fisheries Profile1 as
well as the US Trafficking
Persons Report 20192. The
company has prioritised the
sourcing of seafood as its
main focus due to the nature
and reported challenges in
seafood sourcing.

The most challenging aspect of
seafood supply is that the
primary source of supply
comes from fishing boats which
spend a large proportion of time
out of sight. Policing these boats
and evidencing ethical traceability
is an industry wide challenge.

• Working towards, or achieved
credible certification
(e.g. ASC, Fairtrade,
SMETA).

Inrecognition of thecomplexities
of the fish supply chain we
participate in the Fishermen’s
Welfare Alliance. The Fishermen’s
Welfare Alliance represents
the fish supply chain
through catching sector
representatives, processors
and retail / food service
business and organisations with
health, safety, environmental
and welfare responsibilities.
By working together, we
achieve transparency through
the key stakeholders across
the UK and approach all
issues in a collaborative way
ensuring proactive and
responsible actions are taken
whilst reducing the chance
of unintended consequences.

• Ability to demonstrate
compliance with
international law.

Whitby Seafoods sit on the
Technical Advisory Committee
for the development of a new

Risk mitigation is accounted for
in the risk assessment.
Risk mitigation includes;
• Direct feedback from the
supplier
(e.g. Sedex self-assessment).
• Involvement in multistakeholder efforts.

ethical standard for global
fishing, the Responsible
Fishing Vessel Scheme (RFVS).
This scheme is being managed
by Global Seafood Assurance
and will incorporate the
various labour requirements of
the International Labour
Organisation (ILO) and Food and
Agriculture Organisation (FAO).
We are also members of the
Seafood Ethical Action (SEA)
Alliance. This body has been
established by the seafood
industry to provide a platform
for collective engagement, to
share information on emerging
issues, agree best practice
solutions, and provide a forum
for collective pre-competitive
action where it is not better
fulfilled by an existing
organisation.
The company promotes the
application of the Sedex
self-assessment tool as its
primary vehicle for managing
ethical trading within its
land based supply chain.
Whitby Seafoods will use the
information provided to
identify high risk suppliers
and take appropriate action
to drive improvement in
labour standards. This
includes the option of cease
of supply.

We have developed a remediation
tool internally and will
collaborate with partners
such as NGO’s (non-government
organisations), charities and
law enforcement in creating
effective protective measures
should victims of modern
slavery be identified.
The most prevalent accreditations
for Whitby Seafoods’ business
model that include ethical
approaches to labour outside
UK fishing are;
• A Sedex audit undertaken
by a 3rd party.
• Aquaculture Stewardship
Council (ASC) accreditation.
• An audit conducted by
Whitby Seafoods.
• A human rights impact
assessment by an
independent, competent
3rd party.

Sedex
The Sedex tool allows Whitby
Seafoods to view supplier
self-audit questionnaire
answers against set ethical
criteria. This allows the
business to determine if any
remedial action is required
with the supplier. This tool is
being used widely in the UK to
drive ethical standards and
mitigate risk in the supply
chain. Whitby Seafoods Ltd.
is a member of Sedex
(www.sedexglobal.com).
Sedex is home to one of the
world’s largest collaborative
platform for buyers, suppliers
and auditors to store, share
and report on information
quickly and easily. The platform
is used by more than 43,000
members in over 150 countries
to manage performance around
labour rights, health and
safety, the environment and
business ethics.
By way of example, the Whitby
Seafoods site have repeated an
independent 3rd party Ethical
Audit in May 2019 against the
SMETA (Sedex Members Ethical
Trade Audit) standard. We have
committed to repeat this
exercise in 2020 and every
2 years as a minimum. In 2020,
we also plan to carry out a
SMETA audit at our Kilkeel site.
In 2019, Whitby added 12 new
suppliers to the system, each
being approved ethically
before supply commenced

ASC Accreditation
ASC applies a third-party
certification system to its
accreditation. This ensures the
program is robust, credible and
meets best practice guidelines
for standard-setting organisations
as set out by ISEAL and the FAO
(Food and agricultural organisation
for the United Nations). ISEAL’s
mission is to strengthen
sustainability standards systems
for the benefit of people
and the environment.
The ASC standard has a section
specifically to develop and operate
farms in a socially responsible
manner that contributes effectively
to community development
and poverty alleviation.
Within this there are clauses
that drive minimum standards
in the areas of;
• Forced and compulsory labour.
• Child labour and young
workers.
• Health and safety.
• Freedom of association and
collective bargaining.
• Discrimination.
• Working hours.
• Fair and decent wages.
• Labour contracts.

Risk Assessment
Audits and inspections play an important
part of the due diligence system of
supplier management.

Standards are used to compile
evidence of compliance and
identify any actions required
to address any shortfalls
against these. They are then
prioritised into short,
medium and long term action
plans to show demonstrable
development and continual
improvement.

We have continued to inspect
our
suppliers
overseas
manufacturing sites as part
of our supplier relationship
programme. In 2019 our New
Business Development Director
visited suppliers in Denmark
and China. Our Head of
Technical visited manufacturing
sites in Holland and the UK
as part of expanding our

Audits are written to an
internal standard and
incorporate any customer
requirements. They are an in
depth look at the policies
and procedures a company has
and how they are applied.
Assessments are based on
visual inspection and, by
their nature, are based on
what is seen at the time.
These are utilised by Whitby
Seafoods staff as part of
wider supplier visits. These
often look for physical signs
of violations as indicated by
training given.
Labour provider audits have
been conducted by the Whitby
HR team against internal
standards
without
any
significant deviations.

product portfolio. Our Supply
Chain
Director
visited
suppliers in Germany and The
Republic of Ireland.
No evidence of human rights
violations were observed and
we continue to support the
workforce and community of
this key operational
partner.

Training and
Awareness
Our employees and suppliers play a
pivotal role in helping us to ensure
that modern slavery violations
do not take place in our business
or supply chains.
Over the last year employees from within
the business have taken part in a number
of training or awareness
improving activities.

These include;
• SEDEX risk assessment training
• Enhancement and training out of the
new supplier on boarding process
with respect to ethical compliance
• Feedback on the new version of the
Responsible Fishing Scheme (RFS) for
enhancement of the new scheme when it
is rolled out as a global standard.
• Amendment and re-training of our
Whistleblowing Procedure.
• Engagement with Human Rights at Sea
who are carrying out a benchmarking
exercise on human rights and social
welfare in the UK fishing sector.

In addition to this, in 2019 we;
• Recruited an expert in the role of
Fisheries Improvement Manager. This
new role within our business will
give added capability to tackle the
challenges we and others in our
industry face in tackling the threat
of Modern Slavery
• Added our Modern Slavery Statement to
the TISC database to give the best
available transparency
• Carried out a benchmarking exercise
with Business in the Community to
understand where our programme has
strengths and weaknesses. The results
of this will be available in 2020.

Moving Forward
As outlined in this statement, we continue to build a robust system to assist us in
tackling the challenges associated with modern slavery in our supply chain. In 2019,
we worked with our key first tier suppliers to reduce the risk of Modern Slavery
occurring in our supply chain. In 2020 we plan to continue this work and take
targeted action where we see most risk.
We plan to continue to enhance our internal policies where we see gaps against best
practice and put support mechanisms in place to encourage potential victims to make
themselves known.
We will continue to educate the business internally and within our supply chain. As we
cast our net wider we will train more managers with the Stronger Together toolkit and
attendance at workshops. With our added resource in the area of Fisheries, we continue
to work with our UK nephrops suppliers to understand if any help is needed for them
to support the boat owners from which they buy to adopt best practice. This will give
us visibility of where residual risks lie from which we can initiate action.

Measuring Success
We assess the effectiveness of our systems with key measures. Last year we published
some key measures and this year we have added some relevant sub measures to track
progress. These measures will be monitored throughout 2020 and reported on annually.

Harry Fairbairn – Modern Slavery Statement 2020
In accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (MSA), this Statement provides the measures
that we take to prevent slavery and human trafficking occurring in our business and supply
chains.
Arnold Clark Automobiles Limited is fully committed to preventing acts of modern slavery and
human trafficking from occurring, whether in our business or our supply chains, and we require
the same standards of our suppliers.
This statement will be made available on our website to all who engage with us, whether in
employment or in business, so that those parties may familiarise themselves with the contents.

Who we are
We operate retail sites and service centres across the UK. Our principal activities concern the
sale, hire and servicing of new and used automobiles. We represent 27 new car manufacturers.
We have over 200 dealerships, 160 service centres, 25 accident repair centres and 12 parts
centres. We also have 40 car and van rental locations, 3 training facilities and 6 vehicle leasing
business centres. The Group directly employs over 13,000 people.
Our business functions are broad. Our vehicle aftercare includes MOT testing, accident repairs,
servicing and maintenance of vehicles for both businesses and the general public. We arrange
finance to enable our customers to buy vehicles. We sell parts and accessories from our parts
centres and hire vehicles to the public and to businesses throughout the UK. We provide a suite
of fleet management services to businesses in the public, private and third sectors. We provide
and organise insurance. Our training centres deliver various qualifications, apprenticeships,
business courses and automotive courses.

Areas of risk
Our assessment for 2020 drew similar conclusions to our assessment from 2019 and concluded
that, while risks exist in our recruitment practices and operational site management, the most
significant risks remain in our material and subcontract procurement.
We source and sell products and parts from a wide range of national – and international –
suppliers. Supply chains in the automotive industry are complex, which can make it difficult to
conduct full audits of each tier. Furthermore, raw materials commonly used in the automotive
industry such as cobalt (which is used in electronics), mica (used in some paint finishes) and
rubber (used for tyres and seals) can be supplied by higher risk countries. Finally, some of our

staff members are required to wear company uniforms. The garment industry is considered to
present a high risk of modern slavery in both its national and international supply chains.
Construction has been highlighted by The Chartered Institute of Building as high risk for
modern slavery. This is due to a combination of factors such as a high turnover of staff, a
reliance on migrant workers and low profit margins across the industry. Our construction and
maintenance work is currently outsourced.
Cleaning and valet services also face a higher risk of modern slavery due to similar factors as
those in the construction industry, including high staff turnover and a reliance on migrant
workers. We employ a number of full and part time cleaning and valet staff across our
branches, as well as using external suppliers.

The steps we take to prevent slavery and human trafficking
We prohibit all areas of our business and supply chain from using child labour, slavery, or
human trafficking of any kind. We are committed to taking action to prevent any cases within
our business and to mitigate against the risks of any exploitation throughout our supply chains.
From a supply chain perspective, we make sure that our suppliers commit to our company
values by obtaining written confirmation from all of our suppliers that their business practices
and supply chains are in accordance with the MSA. In procurement, this is evaluated as part of
the tender process, and on a regular basis. We monitor supplier compliance with suitable levels
of due diligence according to their level of risk, which we assess for the potential of human
trafficking and/or modern slavery. However, due to the complexity of the global supply chains
in the automotive industry, we are unable to check every business relationship and avenue
between each tier.
Any instances of non-compliance, alleged modern slavery or human trafficking that we are
made aware of will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. We will quickly and thoroughly
investigate any claim or indication that any area of our business or supply chain is engaging in
human trafficking or slave labour. Any such claim would be reported to senior management as
appropriate. The Board of Directors will be informed of the issue including the findings and
outcome of the investigation.
If such instances are proven, remedial action will be taken and tailored to suit the
circumstances. We will only trade with those who are taking steps towards full compliance. If
we are not satisfied with the steps being taken towards full compliance, we will temporarily
suspend our business with that supplier (to the extent allowed in contract or law). The ultimate
sanction for the continual failure to comply will be for us to cease to trade with that supplier.
Our whistleblowing and employee conduct policies were revised and reissued during the year
to ensure that they remained relevant and are available to all of our members of staff on our
employee portal.
Our estates department only contract with those contractors who are“Alcumus
SafeContractor” approved, in order to guarantee that construction companies are health and
safety accredited. Alcumus SafeContractor are committed to stamping out modern slavery

within the construction industry. For workers on our own sites and locations, we require our
contractors to check that all on site workers carry Construction Skills Certification Scheme
(CSCS) cards which are only granted to licensed labourers and engineers.
Finally, one of our main protections against modern slavery is our employment policies process
which make sure that our organisation complies with minimum wage legislation and that all of
our employees have the right to work in the UK. We also require our contractors to comply with
these standards. While we acknowledge that this does not completely eradicate the risk of
modern slavery, it is one of the most effective ways of combating this risk.
Arnold Clark adopts a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and human trafficking,
therefore we do not record key performance indicators, as any reported instance would be a
breach of our policy.

Action we are taking to combat modern slavery in 2020
While we have made numerous steps towards reducing the risk of modern slavery and human
trafficking within our business, we understand that there is still more that all businesses,
including our own, can do. Some of the steps we are taking in 2020 will help us to do this:

Our Compliance department is engaging with a number of third-party organisations to
discuss ways of implementing a more in-depth social and ethical audit programme to
provide further assurance that our significant and higher risk suppliers are taking the steps
necessary to mitigate against any risks from their own supply chains.
Our Estates team continue to consider ways to improve our due diligence in this area, and is
committed to a collaborative approach with external contractors.
Arnold Clark Automobiles Limited and all its employees are committed to eliminating
modern slavery and human trafficking within our business activities and supply chains.
Employees are encouraged to familiarise themselves with this statement and our
whistleblowing policy to help incorporate our ethical business values within their day-today work.
This statement has been approved by the Arnold Clark Automobiles Limited Board of Directors
and the original statement was signed by our Chief Executive Officer & Group Managing
Director Eddie Hawthorne on 28 July 2020. This statement will be reviewed and updated
annually.

Modern Slavery
Modern Slavery Statement
Financial year ending March 2019

Introduction
This statement sets out the actions CMS Enviro System Ltd. (the Company) has taken to
understand all potential modern slavery risks related to its business and to put in place
steps that are aimed at ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafficking in its own
business and its supply chains. This statement relates to actions and activities during
the financial year 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019.
The Company recognises that it has a responsibility to take a robust approach to slavery
and human trafficking and is absolutely committed to preventing slavery and human
trafficking in its corporate activities, and to ensuring that its supply chains are free from
slavery and human trafficking.
Company structure and supply chains
CMS Enviro Systems Ltd. is an industry leading building envelope contractor specialising
in the design, manufacture and installation of PVCu and aluminium windows, doors and
curtain walling systems. We have over 300 employees and operate throughout the
United Kingdom. Our Head Office is located in Castlecary, Cumbernauld. We have

To find out more about the nature of our business, please visit our website at
www.cmswindows.com.
Our supply chains include the following:

Subcontractors;
Recruitment/labour agencies;
Suppliers of goods, services and materials
Relevant policies
The Company operates the following policies that describe its approach to the
identification of modern slavery risks and steps to be taken to prevent slavery and
human trafficking in its operations:
Whistleblowing Policy: The Company encourages all its workers, customers and other
business partners to report any concerns related to the direct activities, or the supply
chains of, the Company. This includes any circumstances that may give rise to an
enhanced risk of slavery or human trafficking. The Company's whistleblowing procedure
is designed to make it easy for workers to make disclosures, without fear of retaliation.
Supplier code of conduct: The Company is committed to ensuring that its suppliers
adhere to the highest standards of ethics. Suppliers are required to demonstrate that
they provide safe working conditions where necessary, treat workers with dignity and
respect, and act ethically and within the law in their use of labour. The Company works
with suppliers to ensure that they meet the standards of the code and improve their
worker's working conditions. However, serious violations of the Company's supplier
code of conduct will lead to the termination of the business relationship.
Recruitment/Agency Workers: The Company uses only specified, reputable
employment agencies to source labour and always verifies the practices of any new
agency it is using before accepting workers from that agency.
Anti-Bribery & Corruption Policy: The Company is committed to preventing and
prohibiting bribery and corruption in all areas of the Company, including our supply
chain.
Equal Opportunities Policy: The Company is committed to equal opportunities and
the avoidance of discrimination in all our working practices.
Working Time Guidelines : The Company ensures our workers are not subjected to
excessive working hours, overtime/night shift working is optional and encourages
work/life balance.
Due diligence
The Company undertakes due diligence when considering taking on new suppliers, and
regularly reviews its existing suppliers. The Company's due diligence and reviews
include:
mapping the supply chain broadly to assess particular product or geographical risks of

modern slavery and human trafficking;
evaluating the modern slavery and human trafficking risks of each new supplier;
conducting supplier audits, which have a greater degree of focus on slavery and
human trafficking where general risks are identified;
participating in collaborative initiatives focused on human rights in general, and
slavery and human trafficking in particular participation in ""Stronger together"" or
""Ethical trading"" initiatives;
using an ethical supplier database, where suppliers can be checked for their labour
standards, compliance in general, and modern slavery and human trafficking in
particular; and
invoking sanctions against suppliers that fail to improve their performance in line with
an action plan or seriously violate our supplier code of conduct, including the
termination of the business relationship.
Performance indicators
CMS Enviro Systems Ltd. has reviewed its key performance indicators (KPIs). As a result,
the Company is:
requiring supply chain employees and HR professionals to have completed training on
modern slavery by March 2020.
developing a system for supply chain verification, expected to be in place by March
2020, whereby the Company evaluates potential suppliers before they enter the supply
chain; and
reviewing its existing supply chains, expected to be completed by March 2020,
whereby the Company evaluates all existing suppliers.
Training
The Company's modern slavery training will cover:
our business's purchasing practices, which influence supply chain conditions and
which should therefore be designed to prevent purchases at unrealistically low prices,
the use of labour engaged on unrealistically low wages or wages below a country's
national minimum wage, or the provision of products by an unrealistic deadline;
how to assess the risk of slavery and human trafficking in relation to various aspects of
the business, including resources and support available;
how to identify the signs of slavery and human trafficking;
what initial steps should be taken if slavery or human trafficking is suspected;
how to escalate potential slavery or human trafficking issues to the relevant parties

within the Company;
what external help is available, for example through the Modern Slavery Helpline,
Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority and ""Stronger together"" initiative;
what steps the Company should take if suppliers or contractors do not implement
anti-slavery policies in high-risk scenarios, including their removal from the Company's
supply chains.
Awareness-raising programme
As well as training staff, the Company will raise awareness of modern slavery issues by
putting up posters across the Company's premises and circulating of emails to staff.
The posters and emails will explain to staff:
the basic principles of the Modern Slavery Act 2015;
how employers can identify and prevent slavery and human trafficking;
what employees can do to flag up potential slavery or human trafficking issues to the
relevant parties within the Company; and
what external help is available, for example through the Modern Slavery Helpline.
Board approval
This statement was approved on 19 April 2019 by CMS Enviro Systems Ltd.’s board of
directors who review and update it annually.

Last Updated: October 2019

•

We consider we currently have no high risk activities.

Responsibility
2.5. Responsibility for the organisation's anti-slavery initiatives is as follows

3.

•

Policies: The Human Resources Manager and the Legal Services Manager are jointly
responsible for reviewing this policy and the Procurement Manager is responsible for
keeping under review contract procedures where a risk is identified in the supply chain.
This policy will be reviewed on a 3 year cycle or when legislation changes.

•

Risk assessments/Investigations/due diligence: It is the responsibility of the
Procurement Manager to ensure that procurement processes are robust in identifying
potential risks in relation to slavery and human trafficking, and mitigating these risks as
far as possible.

•

Responsibility: It is the responsibility of the officer responsible for safeguarding to
ensure any risks or issues identified outside of the supply chain are dealt with
appropriately and in a timely fashion and in accordance with safeguarding procedures.

Relevant policies

3.1. The council operates the following policies that describe their approach to the identification
of modern slavery risks and steps to be taken to prevent slavery and human trafficking in
their operations.
•

Whistleblowing policy - We encourage all our workers, customers and other business
partners to report any concerns related to the direct activities, or the supply chains of,
the organisation. This includes any circumstances that may give rise to an enhanced risk
of slavery or human trafficking. The council’s whistleblowing procedure is designed to
make it easy for workers to make disclosures, without fear of retaliation.

•

Employee code of conduct - The code makes clear to employees the actions and
behaviour expected of them when representing the council. We strive to maintain the
highest standards of employee conduct and ethical behaviour when managing the
supply chain.

•

Supplier Selection – We are committed to ensuring that suppliers adhere to the highest
standards of ethics. Since 1 October 2015, commercial organisations that carry on a
business or part of business in the UK, supply goods or services and have an annual
turnover of £36 million or more have been required under Section 54 of the Act to
prepare a slavery and human trafficking statement as defined by section 54 of the Act.
The Act requires suppliers tendering for OJEU contracts to comply with the
requirements of Modern Slavery Act 2015, as a mandatory selection criteria.

Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement - October 2019
Page 2 of 4
Last Updated: October 2019

We allow potential suppliers to self-declare that they meet the relevant criteria in the
supplier selection stage. If a supplier seriously misrepresents any factual information in
filling in the procurement documentation, and so induce an authority to enter into a
contract, the council will seek damages in the event that a contract has been awarded to a
bidder as a result of receiving false information. The supplier may be excluded from the
procurement process, and from tendering for other contracts for three years. If fraud, or
fraudulent intent, can be proved, the supplier or supplier’s responsible officers may be
prosecuted and convicted of the offence of fraud by false representation, and the supplier
must be excluded from further procurements for five years; all potential suppliers are
required to provide up to date information.

4.

•

Recruitment/Agency workers policy - We use only specified, reputable employment
agencies to source labour and always verifies the practices of any new agency it is using
before accepting workers from that agency. New employees are thoroughly and
properly vetted for their eligibility to work in the UK in accordance with Home Office
and Cabinet Office security guidelines as appropriate.

•

Safeguarding children and vulnerable adults policy. Our safeguarding policy sets out
our duty to spot signs of potential abuse amongst children and vulnerable adults, which
may include signs of trafficking or modern slavery.

Performance

4.1. We consider ourselves to be low risk on the basis that we have no suppliers from outside the
UK or staff working abroad. However, the council do:

5.

•

Require all HR Professionals to be suitably qualified in relation to recruitment
procedures. Further all recruiting managers are supported by HR staff and training is
offered in recruitment and interviewing techniques.

•

Have in place procurement procedures written and amended in the light of the Act; and

•

Keep under review supply chain and contract procedures.

Training

5.1. The council will seek to incorporate an on-line/e-learning package for staff including those
regularly awarding OJEU contracts, those in roles involving significant contact with the public,
and HR professionals working within the council, providing training on modern slavery in the
next two years.
5.2. Our modern slavery training will cover:
•

our business's procurement practices, which influence supply chain conditions and
which should therefore be designed to prevent purchases at unrealistically low prices,
the use of labour engaged on unrealistically low wages or wages below a country's
national minimum wage, or the provision of products by an unrealistic deadline;

MODERN SLAVERY ACT
STATEMENT
1. Introduction
Alamo Group Europe (and all entities
controlled and/or affiliated with Alamo
Group Europe) have a strong commitment
to prohibiting human trafficking and slavery
by any of its business entities, employees,
and other associated parties. In compliance
with the law, and to underline Alamo Group
Europe’s commitment to prohibiting these
practices, this anti-slavery and human
trafficking statement serves to ensure a
work environment that is free from human
trafficking, forced labour and unlawful child
labour. Alamo Group Europe strongly
believes it is responsible for promoting
ethical and lawful employment practices
amongst the Alamo Group Europe
companies. These practices are also
required to be followed by our suppliers,
subcontractors or business partners. Alamo
Group Europe strongly opposes any use of
slavery or human trafficking in the
distribution of its own products and fully
supports the promotion of ethical and
lawful business practice within the
workplace.

2. Organisational Structure
Alamo Group Europe is a limited company
registered in the UK (registered company

high quality equipment for infrastructure
maintenance, agriculture and other

suppliers also include, professional services
(accountants, legal advisors, recruitment
agencies); cleaning services, IT and
Communications systems, Office Suppliers
etc.
Suppliers paid over £100,000 per year
make up 98% of our supplier spend and of
these the majority have an annual turnover
of >36m and are, therefore, themselves
covered by the Modern Slavery Act
requirements.

4. Our Policies on Slavery and Human
Trafficking

no modern slavery or human trafficking in

business. Our anti-slavery policy reflects our

5. Due Diligence Processes for
Slavery and Human Trafficking
Our Anti-Slavery Policy reflects our
commitment to acting ethically and with
integrity in all our business relationship and
implementing and enforcing effective
systems and controls to prevent slavery and
human trafficking practices in our supply
chains.
To help identify any potential risks within
our supply chains (including in respect of
new suppliers and commercial
arrangements), we undertake a due
diligence assessment taking into
consideration the following factors:

Geographical location of the business
or manufacture/supply of goods;
Industry sector – we recognise that
certain sectors suffer greater
exposure to slavery and human
trafficking practices;
Value of the contract/commercial
arrangement;
Supplier’s dependency upon our
business;
Scope of the suppliers’ supply chain
e.g. does the supplier manufacture or
provide goods themselves or supply
them from a third party;
In the event that any supplier/commercial
arrangement is considered to be a potential
risk, we will undertake further due diligence
until we are satisfied that we have achieved
compliance with the law and ethical
practices.
We have also put in place system,
procedures and best practices to help
combat anti-ethical practices and modern
slavery within our supply chains and
general business operations. For example,
we:

Continually monitor potential risk
areas in our supply chains using the
services of Transparency International
UK.
Protect whistle blowers to ensure that
they are not discouraged from raising
any concerns relating to unethical or
illegal practices;
Adopt robust recruitment processes
in line with UK employment laws,
including: ‘right to work’ document
checks; contracts of employment and
checks to ensure everyone employed
is 16 and above;
Engage with reputable businesses
and individual with a proven track
record of legal compliance and good
ethical standards;
Have robust policies in place to
ensure a new employee has the Right
to Work in the UK and have
confirmed their identity prior to the
commencement of employment or
placement.
Train our staff and business partners
on their obligations under the
applicable laws and regulations.
Completion of our Code of Ethics
training module for all employees.
Pay and reward our staff in

ensuring that we comply with the principles
and commitments set out in this statement.
Our compliance team consists of members
of Finance, HR, Purchasing and Sales, and

advisors to ensure we act in accordance
with the law.

7. Training
To ensure a high level of understanding of
the risks of modern slavery and human
trafficking in our supply chains and our
business, we provide training to our staff.

This is enshrined within our Code of
Business Conduct and Ethics Procedure.
Our effectiveness in combating slavery and
human trafficking within our organisation
and supply chain is measured by reference
to the number of reports received from
employees, the public or law enforcement
agencies to indicate that modern slavery
practices have been identified. This
statement is made pursuant to section 54(1)
of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and
constitutes our slavery and human
trafficking statement for the financial year
ending 31st December 2017.

Anti Slavery Policy

ANTI SLAVERY STATEMENT
Pentagon Investments Limited and Group of Companies including:
Lawrence Vehicles Limited (T/A Lothian DAF and Lancashire DAF)
Meadow Group Services Limited
Mertrux Limited
Pentagon Vehicle Rentals Limited

Anti - Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy
Purpose
This statement is made pursuant to Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out the steps the
Company is taking to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our supply chains or in
any part of our business.

Introduction from Ian Marshall, Group Managing Director
Modern slavery is a crime resulting in an abhorrent abuse of the human rights of vulnerable workers. It can
take various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labour and human trafficking. The
Company has a zero tolerance approach to modern slavery and is committed to acting ethically and with
integrity and transparency in all of its business dealings and relationships and to implementing and enforcing
effective systems and controls to ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking are not taking place
anywhere within either its own business or in any of its supply chains, consistent with its obligations under
the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

The Company also expects the same high standards from its suppliers, contractors and other business
partners and, as part of its contracting processes, it includes specific prohibitions against the use of modern
slavery and expects that its suppliers will in turn hold their own suppliers to the same standards.
Slavery and human trafficking remain a hidden blight on our global society. We all have a responsibly to be
alert to the risks, however small, in our business and in the wider supply chain. Staff are expected to report
concerns and management are expected to act upon them.

Ian Marshall
Group Managing Director

Organisation’s Structure
Mertrux Limited is a franchised Mercedes-Benz Commercial Vehicle Dealer and retails and repairs the
Mercedes Benz Van and Truck range. In addition, the group retails commercial vehicle parts and
accessories as part of the Mercedes Benz UK network. Mertrux has its head office in Derby and branches in
Derby, Leicester, Mansfield and Nottingham. The group has an annual turnover in excess of £103m.
Lawrence Vehicles Limited is a franchised DAF Commercial Vehicle Dealer and retails and repairs the DAF
Truck range. In addition, the group retails commercial vehicle parts and accessories as part of the DAF UK
network. Lawrence Vehicles Limited has its head office in Derby and has branches in Lancashire and
Lothian. The group has an annual turnover in excess of £113m.
Pentagon Investments Limited is the parent company for both Mertrux Limited, Lawrence Vehicles Limited
and supporting companies Pentagon Vehicle Rentals Limited and Meadow Group Services who provide
group services including Human Resources, Financial Services and IT.
Our Business
The group employs approximately 355 people over 6 main sites.
Our Supply Chains
Our supply chain includes the sourcing of vehicles, bodies, ancillary equipment and parts relating to the sale
and repair of new commercial vehicles.
The automotive supply chain is one of the most complicated of any industry. There are often six to ten levels
of suppliers between an automaker and the source of raw materials that enter the manufacturing process.
The breadth, depth and interconnectedness of the automotive supply chain make it challenging to effectively

manage business and sustainability issues. Respecting human rights and environmental issues in the supply
chain is ultimately our suppliers’ responsibility. As customers, however, we play an active role in supplier
development and have adopted various means to clearly communicate our expectations to our suppliers.
Guiding principles
We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in any part of business or
in our supply chains. Our Anti-slavery Policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in
all our business relationships and to implementing effective systems and controls to prevent slavery and
human trafficking taking place anywhere in our supply chains.
Due Diligence Processes for Slavery and Human Trafficking
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk –
We employ a Human Resources Team who vet all applicants thoroughly and work closely with any
agencies and 3rd parties who provide us with potential labour.
Where possible we build long standing relationships with our suppliers and make clear our expectations
of business behaviour.
With regards to national or international supply chains, our point of contact is preferably with a UK
company or branch and we expect these entities to have suitable anti-slavery and human trafficking
policies and processes.
We expect each entity in the chain to, at least, adopt ‘one-up’ due diligence on the next link in the chain.
It is not practical for us (and every other participant in the chain) to have a direct relationship with all links
in the chain, ultimately to component manufacturers.
We have in place systems to encourage the reporting of concerns and the protection of whistle blowers.
We operate a whistleblowing policy so that all employees know that they can raise concerns about how
colleagues are being treated, or practices within our business or supply chain, without fear of reprisals.
We operate a robust recruitment policy, including conducting eligibility to work in the UK checks for all
employees to safeguard against human trafficking or individuals being forced to work against their will.
We applaud the work being done to reduce forced labour and human trafficking in the UK. We are
communicating to our staff our policy and awareness training will take place to complement and reinforce
this. Training in this area will be provided to key personnel within the business.
Responsibility
We expect all those in our supply chain and contractors comply with our values.
The Directors and Senior Managers are responsible for compliance in their respective departments and for
their supplier relationships.
We use the following key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure how effective we have been to ensure
that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any part of our business or supply chains:
Use of labour monitoring and HR/Payroll systems
Authorised Suppliers listing to be maintained and audited.

All Managers will be briefed on issues around third-party labour exploitation.
Ensure that labour sourcing, recruitment and placement processes are under the control of trusted staff
members and are not open to corruption.
Encourage workers to report cases of hidden third-party labour exploitation and investigate and act on
reports appropriately.

Modern Slavery Statement

Introduction
This statement sets out Civica's actions to understand all potential modern slavery risks related to
its business and to put in place steps that are aimed at ensuring that there is no slavery or human
tra cking in its own business and its supply chains.
Civica Group Limited, including its associated and subsidiary companies, recognises that it has a
responsibility under the Modern Slavery Act 2015 to take a robust approach to slavery and human
tra cking and we are absolutely committed to preventing slavery and human tra cking in our
corporate activities, and to ensuring that our supply chains are free from slavery and human

solutions used by more than two million professionals. We operate across the UK, Ireland,
Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, India and the USA, our supply chains are predominantly based
within these countries.

slavery risks and steps to be taken to prevent slavery and human tra cking in our operations:
HR Policy - We have zero tolerance of any threat of physical or sexual violence, harassment
or intimidation against employees and their family, or close associates. Our policies are
clearly de ned and communicated to all employees. All our employees are treated fairly and

internal controls including but not limited to Civica’s ‘Quality Management’, ‘Environmental’,
‘Ethical Code of practice’, ‘Anti-Bribery’ and ‘Modern slavery and Human Tra cking’ policies

is placed on selecting suppliers and service providers that demonstrate recognisable
environmental, sustainable, business integrity along with Corporate Social Responsible (CSR)
standards including but not limited to compliance with laws and regulations, respect for
human rights, labour working conditions, equal opportunities, health and safety
accreditation, maintenance and promotion of information security, fair trade and acceptable

suppliers on a periodic basis. Our due diligence and reviews include:
Mapping the supply chain broadly to assess particular product or geographical risks of
modern slavery and human tra cking
Evaluating the modern slavery and human tra cking risks of each new supplier
Conducting supplier audits or assessments which have a greater degree of focus on slavery
and human tra cking where general risks are identi ed
Invoking sanctions against suppliers that fail to improve their performance in line with an
action plan or seriously violate our supplier code of conduct, including the termination of the
business relationship.

Awareness-Raising Programme
As well as training employees, the organisation has raised awareness of modern slavery issues by
circulating information to employees.
The information explained to relevant employees:
The basic principles of the Modern Slavery Act 2015;
How employers can identify and prevent slavery and human tra cking;
What employees can do to ag up potential slavery or human tra cking issues to the
relevant parties within the organisation; and
What external help is available, for example through the Modern Slavery Helpline.

March 2019 Update
This is the third year of reporting on modern slavery from the Civica Group, and during the 2018
nancial year, we have continued to review and increase our depth of work on modern slavery
and ensure that we have put in place the most e ective responses where risks have been
identi ed. Our commitment to ensuring the prevention of slavery and human tra cking, either
within our business or within our supply chain, is very clear. We will always treat people in our
business and in our supply chain fairly.

Since the introduction of the modern slavery act, we have continued to review our supplier base,
identifying those suppliers who we regard as high risk. The new supplier set-up process outlined
in 2018 continues to be applied, and we have extended these arrangements to suppliers whose
arrangements transfer to us following acquisitions. Through these processes, we have identi ed
two suppliers in high risk countries and worked to assess the risks of these suppliers. We are
pleased to con rm that no risks have been identi ed following our review.
We continue to ensure that the working conditions for all of our employees continue to exceed
the statutory requirements in all of the countries that we operate in, and we conduct regular
reviews against market standards. The continued expansion of our Vadodara o ce has increased
our presence within India, and we continue to be an employer of choice within the local region. In
addition, we have been identi ed within the UK as a Top 25 Employer of Choice and a Top 30
Flexible Employer. In Australia, we have also been identi ed as a Great Place to Work. We continue
to apply these standards across the Group, and in 2019 will seek to gain accreditations for our
remaining locations, ensuring that our employees are treated fairly and equitably.
We have also continued to review our Group policies and have improved our whistleblowing
policy, ensuring that there is an anonymous process for employees, customers and other business
partners to report their concerns related to the direct activities, or the supply chains of Civica. Our
whistleblowing procedure continues to be designed to make it easy for employees to make
disclosures without fear of retaliation.
Due to the nature of the business, we have not identi ed any high-risk Modern Slavery concerns
in 2018.
March 2020 Update
This is the fourth year of reporting on modern slavery from the Civica Group. We continue to
ensure that the working conditions for all of our employees continue to exceed the statutory
requirements in all of the countries that we operate in, and we conduct regular reviews against
market standards. The continued expansion of our Vadodara o ce has increased our presence
within India to more than 500 people and we continue to be an employer of choice within the
local region.
In addition, we have been reaccredited as an Investors in People Gold business as well as a
Glassdoor 2019 Top 25 Employer of Choice in the UK. In Australia, we have also been identi ed as
a Great Place to Work. We continue to apply these standards across the Group, and in 2020 we
are seeking to improve and build on our standing as an Employer of Choice.
We also continue to review our Group policies and practices around diversity and inclusivity and
are listed as a Financial Times Diversity Leader in 2020.

We have improved our whistleblowing policy, ensuring that there is an anonymous process for
employees, customers and other business partners to report their concerns related to the direct
activities, or the supply chains of Civica. Our whistleblowing procedure continues to be designed
to make it easy for employees to make disclosures without fear of retaliation.
Due to the nature of the business, we have not identi ed any high-risk Modern Slavery concerns
in 2019.

As an international business, Civica recognises that modern
slavery and human tra cking are signi cant global issues that
present challenges for businesses around the world. In line with
our values of Knowledge, Integrity and Action, we are committed
to continually improving our practices to combat modern slavery
and human tra cking within our supply chains. We have a zero
tolerance approach to these issues and act with integrity in all of
our business arrangements.

Slavery and human trafficking statement (2020-21)
This statement explains how Durham County Council aims to understand and
address all potential modern slavery and human trafficking risks related to its
business. It outlines the steps in place to ensure modern slavery or human trafficking
does not occur in the Council's own business, and the preventative measures to
ensure this extends to any of its supply chains. This statement is subject to continual
annual review and will be published on the Council's website.

Commitment
Durham County Council as a public sector organisation, employer, community leader and a procurer
is committed to undertaking a preventative approach to modern slavery and human trafficking within
its corporate responsibilities and activities. This also includes co-operating with partners and internal
services, such as, adult care, human resources and corporate procurement to work towards the
disruption of such activities.

Organisational Structure and Supply Chains
County Durham is the largest local authority in the North East of England with over half a million
residents. The population size has risen consecutively over the last 14 years. Durham County Council
provides a range of services, including Children's Services, Adult and Health Services, Public Health,
and Environmental Services. The Council directly delivers some services but also works in
partnership with other organisations and commissions and procures services externally. In 2019-2020
the total third party spend was £500 million. Specific services covered by this statement illustrated in
the structure below.

x

Durham County Council agreed with stakeholders that the mechanism to seek assurance of a
commitment to improving practice and preventing slavery and human trafficking sits with the Local
Safeguarding Adults Board governance arrangements.
Slavery and human trafficking also spans wider partnerships, such as, the Durham Safeguarding
Children Partnership and Safe Durham Partnership.

Supply Chains
There is a clear expectation thatexternal services or goods procured by the Council be undertaken in
conjunction with organisations operating their own policy and practice in relation to modern slavery.
All suppliers bidding in Durham County Council's procurement processes must state whether they are
a relevant commercial organisation as defined by section 54 (""Transparency in supply chains etc."") of
the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (""the Act""). If they are, they are required to confirm their compliance
with the annual reporting requirements contained within Section 54 of the Act. Failure to meet these
requirements are treated as a ground for Mandatory Exclusion. The above approach adopted by
Durham County Council is in line with that developed by Crown Commercial Services, the executive
agency and trading fund of the Cabinet Office of the UK Government, and is utilised nationally across
the public sector.
In addition to addressing its obligations during the procurement process, the Council previously
undertook an assurance activity (with 250 of its key suppliers) to ensure that relevant
organisations/suppliers produce and publish an annual slavery and human trafficking statement each
year. The statement summarises the steps organisations have taken to ensure that slavery is absent
from their supply chains in line with the Modern Slavery Act.
Durham County Council has an expectation that any organisation with which we work, commission a
service or procure a service from, operates appropriate policy and practice in relation to modern
slavery.

Our Responsibilities
In line with requirements placed upon Durham County Council, there is commitment to ensuring there
is no modern slavery and/or human trafficking in our supply chains.
Durham County Council has a corporate crosscutting role as an employer, community leader and
procurer with responsibility to safeguard people within our communities. This extends responsibilities
to Adult Social Care, Children's Social Care, Housing, Corporate Procurement, Human Resources as
well as Community Safety. Durham County Council works closely with Durham Constabulary and

other enforcement agencies as appropriate to share intelligence and work collaboratively to address
issues relating to modern slavery or human trafficking. Working with partners, guidance and clear
pathways to support and signpost victims for appropriate support is in place.

Our Policies
As a Council, there are a wide range of policies and processes in place that reflect our commitment to
prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in everything that we do.
All policies are subject to a robust assurance process, and agreed by the relevant board or
committee. This can include councillors, senior officers and/or partner organisations.
Code of Values, Behaviours and Conduct (2019) - Durham County Council expects high standards of
conduct from its employees. This code sets out the minimum standards expected of all employees,
including treating others with dignity and respect and in fair and impartial manner in line with the
Council Equality policy. Employees will adhere to all standards set out it in the code inclusive of
procurement activity.
Confidential Reporting Code (August 2017) - Durham County Council confidential reporting
(whistleblowing) code reiterates a commitment to the highest possible standards of openness,
honesty and accountability. 'Whistleblowing' is the term used when an employee passes on
information concerning wrongdoing. Often referred to as 'making a disclosure' or 'blowing the whistle'.
The code applies to employees, former employees, job applicants, and agency staff working for the
council, contractors and suppliers. All individuals to whom the code applies can utilise it to report any
concerns that may infer a heightened risk of modern slavery or human trafficking in relation to Council
activities and/or its supply chains.
Equality & Diversity Policy (2017) - The Council as a major employer and provider of services is
committed to advancing equality of opportunity and providing fair access and treatment in
employment and when delivering or procuring services or working in partnership. The Council in its
two Equality and Diversity Policies for both its citizens and employees makes clear its responsibility
under the public sector equality duty under the Equality Act 2010. Effective procurement can drive
progress in equality and embed real improvement. Equality is therefore considered and embedded in
the Corporate Procurement Strategy, and ensures commissioned services are appropriate and
responsive to different groups.
Corporate Procurement Strategy (2016 - 2019 - Under Review) - The current strategy (
Procurement Strategy 2020-2024 (PDF, 1.4mb) ) covers the period up to the financial year of 2019
and is in line with the Altogether Better vision of the Council (replaced by Our Vision 2035). The
Council aims to ensure that all commissioning and procurement activities carried out in collaboration
do so in an economically, environmentally and socially responsible manner. This includes ensuring
high-risk works and services are subject to effective evaluation and contributing to community
cohesion by addressing equalities issues in the supply chain. Corporate Procurement staff recently
completed the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS) training for Ethical Procurement
& Supply and in turn, now utilise the Corporate Ethics kitemark.
Recruitment and Selection Policy (2020) - The Council undertakes its own recruitment activity through
in-house functions. Robust processes are in place to ensure that the policy is adhered to and all
employees with a responsibility for recruitment and selection must be aware of their legal obligations
under existing employment legislation. Agency appointments are subject to the same rigour as
Council appointed employees, for example, DBS checks (where applicable); proof of eligibility to work
in the UK; any gaps in employment history. The Council through its corporate procurement seeks
assurance that its Agency supplier is complying with its duties under the Act.

Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence - The Safe Durham Partnership (SDP) has 'protecting
vulnerable people from harm' as a key priority of its overarching plan for 2020-2025. Its vision is to
ensure every adult and child will be, and will feel safe. This includes working with partners to prevent
domestic abuse and sexual violence and reducing the associated harm. Access to help and support
through services is available to address needs. It includes improving the criminal justice response to
tackling domestic abuse, sexual violence and sexual exploitation. Adult Care and Children Service's
are active members of the local Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence Executive Group.
Safeguarding People in our Communities - The Council has a duty to safeguard people in our
communities and for ensuring policies are in place to protect vulnerable groups from harm and abuse.
The Care Act 2014 sets out duties in relation to safeguarding adults and for children the duty comes
from the Children Act 1989. Working Together to Safeguard Children 2018 sets out the expectations
of all agencies involved in the safeguarding function. All Children and Adult Care teams of the Council
hold responsibilities to meet these duties on a daily basis.
A wide range of information is accessible to staff across both service groupings and wider service
areas. This extends to modern slavery and human trafficking.

Multi-agency arrangements
The Local Safeguarding Adults Board in line with statutory requirements set out within the Care Act
2014 have an agreed multi-agency safeguarding policy and procedure in place. Regular review
across a broad range of policy and practice takes place.
In addition, the Local Safeguarding Adults Board has worked with partners to develop modern slavery
and sexual exploitation referral pathways. The Board continues to work in collaboration with the wider
safeguarding system where there are links for example, the Safe Durham Partnership multi-agency
domestic abuse referral pathway and local safeguarding children arrangements.
The Durham Safeguarding Children Partnership have up to date on-line procedures in relation to
domestic abuse, child sexual exploitation and modern slavery.
For more information, visit the Durham Safeguarding Children Partnership and the County Durham
Safeguarding Adults Partnership websites.

Management Responsibilities
The Council has responsibilities to its workforce, this includes employee health, safety and welfare.
As part of the Council commitment to the welfare of its workforce, any employee can raise concerns
and have assurance from the Council that their concerns will be taken seriously.
Managers regularly undertake supervision or 1-1 sessions with staff during which health and safety or
health and wellbeing concerns that an employee may have can be discussed.
The Council also offers work related and personal advice and support to its employees covering a
broad range of issues from better health at work, to victims of crime. Employees have access to 24hour confidential support, 365 days per year and to contacts for external support.

Training & Awareness Raising
To meet its statutory safeguarding responsibilities, the Council offers a wide and extensive training
programme to staff across all services.
The Local Safeguarding Adults and Durham Safeguarding Children Partnership continue to provide a
range of training including regular briefings for Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking and face to

face opportunities through a variety of events.
Our E-briefings continue to provide up to date information on a range of related topics, including
reporting via the Safe Car Wash app, social media campaigns, consultations and any National and/or
annual Modern Slavery reports and related guidance.
Recognising, reporting and responding to modern slavery and human trafficking is embedded within
the LSAB training programmes and in collaboration with Durham Constabulary. Training includes key
messages of the signs and indicators of modern slavery and human trafficking, sharing of intelligence
and the relevant referral pathway for potential victims, including the National Referral Mechanism and
accessible support for victims.
In September 2019, the Safe Durham Partnership received an update report of the local picture for
modern slavery and human trafficking. In October 2019, the Council and Durham Constabulary
hosted a seminar with Councillors and wider stakeholders with a focus upon Modern Slavery and
Human Trafficking. In November 2019, the Safer and Stronger Communities Overview and Scrutiny
Committee received an update of local activity, which included the work of the Council and the links to
wider partnership working.
Each year the safeguarding partnerships in collaboration with the Safe Durham Partnership host a
Safeguarding Week. In November 2019, the partnerships worked together to deliver key messages
for County Lines and Criminal Exploitation as just one theme during that week. Over 120 delegates
attended with 28 stallholders, promoting and raising awareness of key safeguarding issues including
Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking.
Relevant communications, briefing sessions and up to date training continues to be accessible to all
Council employees across all service groupings and the wider workforce.
Training attendance is captured throughout the year and continues to support an accurate picture of
the wider workforce trained under the remit of the Board. It also offers further assurance of the
delivery of standard and consistent messages across the wider workforce. Local Clinical
Commissioning Group colleagues support the delivery of key messages by providing updates to
General Practices across County Durham.
If any staff witness or suspect modern slavery or human trafficking is taking place, they can seek
advice or report their concerns to the police on 101. In line with statutory responsibilities and related
guidance for local authorities, the police and others, may need to make a notification where a
potential victim of modern slavery is identified to the National Referral Mechanism.
Further information is available from the Local Safeguarding Adult Board andDurham Safeguarding
Children Partnership training pages.
As a partner of the Local Safeguarding Adults Board and Durham Safeguarding Children Partnership
the Council is committed to raising the profile of modern slavery and human trafficking. The Local
Safeguarding Adults Board on behalf of its partners and in line with its awareness raising priority has
shared key messages through its quarterly newsletter.
Council intranet pages are a vital platform to share information with employees; Council Directors of
Service Groupings are committed to connecting with employees and cascading relevant updates on
legislation and guidance.

Due Diligence
Durham County Council is committed to and understands the vital role procurement plays in its
functions. This includes the consideration and recognition when sourcing any provision that effective
employment practice takes place and all modern slavery and human trafficking practices are

discouraged.
Due diligence actions must be carried out at all times in collaboration, between Contract Managers
and Corporate Procurement Officers, to ensure before awarding any contracts to prospective bidders
the Council meets its legal obligations under the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
Where suppliers fail to meet their appropriate obligations under the Modern Slavery Act 2015, the
issue should be raised by the assigned Contract Manager, in order to protect the Council's reputation
and remain compliant under the regulations going forward.
Regular monitoring and assurance activities take place to ensure compliance of suppliers' obligations
under the Modern Slavery Act by all Local Authorities.

Performance
Durham County Council submits a Safeguarding Adults Collection (SAC) on an annual basis to NHS
Digital. The return currently includes voluntary data for modern slavery reported concerns for adults
with care and support needs. In 2019-2020 there were less than six* reported concerns to Social
Care Direct (DCC) for suspected Modern Slavery. To ensure the safety of potential victims, each
report is actioned in line with requirements upon the Council. Following review of each case, and if
applicable, a duty to notify in line with Section 52 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 is completed and
any support requirements for potential victims is addressed. Reports are also made direct to Durham
Constabulary, who hold a lead role to address Modern Slavery within County Durham.

Declaration
This statement is made pursuant to Section 54 (1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes
Durham County Council's slavery and human trafficking statement for the term of the financial period
of 1st April 2020 to 31st March 2021.

The Wates Group is proud of the ethical standards that we have embedded into our business over
many years, and we believe that these standards are consistent with the underlying principles of the
Modern Slavery Act 2015. Slavery and the trafficking of people have no place in the modern world.
Wates has a zero-tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking and we expect our supply

effective systems and controls to ensure that we address the threat of modern slavery within our
business and in all of our business relationships, including in our supply chains.

OUR POLICY ON ANTI-SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND OUR CODE OF CONDUCT

The Wates Group Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy may be found here and our core values
are underpinned by our Code of Conduct. Appropriate action is taken to investigate any breach of
our policy or our Code of Conduct.
Our Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy reflects a long-standing commitment to acting
ethically and with integrity in all of our business relationships, supported by the development and
implementation of effective systems and controls.
We are committed to ensuring, so far as we are able, that there is no modern slavery or human
trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. Our supply chains include subcontractors, suppliers, labour agencies and professional services providers. We take a zerotolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking and we expect our supply chain to comply with
our values as set out in our Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy and Code of Conduct.
OUR ANTI-SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING ASSURANCE PROCESS
As part of an initiative to identify and mitigate risk in respect of slavery and human trafficking we
have:

1

•

Established a working group tasked with evaluating the risk of modern slavery occurring in
our supply chain and implementing proportionate and effective systems and controls to
ensure that we address the risk;

•

Regularly evaluated the nature and extent of our exposure to the risk of modern slavery
occurring in our supply chain by carrying out annual slavery and human trafficking risk
assessments to enable us to apply a risk-based and proportionate approach to dealing with
any issues;

•

Updated our Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy based upon our risk assessments;

•

Reviewed the contracts that we have with our supply chains and amended these to require
compliance with the Act;

•

Mandated, where appropriate, that our supply chains be registered with the Constructionline
validation system, which requires our supply chains to confirm their compliance with the Act;

•

Updated our pre-qualification questionnaires (which form part of our process for accepting
our supply chains onto our approved supplier list) to include specific questions on modern
slavery and human trafficking. The responses to these questionnaires are reviewed by our
procurement team;

•

Developed a third party auditing process for targeted, high risk projects in circumstances
where we are procuring directly. We have obtained information on the measures that our high
risk supply chains are carrying out to ensure that modern slavery and human trafficking is
not taking place. Where we consider that these measures are not sufficient, we work with our
supply chain to improve their approach;

•

Held a modern slavery workshop with our key labour agencies;

•

Commenced modern slavery compliance audits with our key labour agencies; and

•

Widened the scope of the Wates Group whistle-blowing procedures to include the reporting
of modern slavery and human trafficking issues, so that any individual may confidentially
raise a potential issue.

TRAINING
We invest in educating our staff to recognise the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in
our business and supply chains. To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks we are providing
training to our staff that is proportionate to the level of risk, including online and face-to-face training,
where appropriate. Employees are encouraged to identify and report any potential breaches of
Wates’ Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy and Code of Conduct.
DEVELOPING FOR THE FUTURE
Continued internal monitoring of our supply chains remains a priority for the Wates Group. Those
suppliers that have been identified as high risk are more heavily monitored to ensure that their
working practices (and those of their supply chain) are compliant.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and
constitutes the slavery and human trafficking statement for the Wates Group and its Group
companies for the financial year ending 31 December 2018.

POLICY STATEMENT
This statement is made pursuant to Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out the steps that HG
Construction (Holdings) Limited has taken and is continuing to take to ensure that modern slavery or human
trafficking is not taking place within our business or supply chain.
Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. It takes various forms, such as slavery,
servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a
person’s liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain. We have a zero-tolerance
approach to modern slavery and we are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings
and relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is
not taking place anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains.
We are also committed to ensuring there is transparency in our own business and in our approach to tackling
modern slavery throughout our supply chains, consistent with our disclosure obligations under the Modern Slavery
Act 2015. We expect the same high standards from all of our contractors, suppliers and other business partners,
and as part of our contracting processes, we include specific prohibitions against the use of forced, compulsory or
trafficked labour, or anyone held in slavery or servitude, whether adults or children, and we expect that our suppliers
will hold their own suppliers to the same high standards.
This policy applies to all full and part-time employees, as well as temporary staff, whenever they are working. It also
applies to agents, contractors and other third parties acting on our behalf in any capacity.
This policy does not form part of any employee’s contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.

RESPONSIBILITY
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for ensuring this policy complies with our legal and ethical
obligations, and that all those under our control comply with it.
The SHEQ Compliance Manager has primary and day-to-day responsibility for implementing this policy, monitoring
its use and effectiveness, dealing with any queries about it, and auditing internal control systems and procedures
to ensure they are effective in countering modern slavery.
Management at all levels are responsible for ensuring those reporting to them understand and comply with this
policy and are given adequate and regular training on it and the issue of modern slavery in supply chains.
You are invited to comment on this policy and suggest ways in which it might be improved. Comments, suggestions
and queries are encouraged and should be addressed to the SHEQ Compliance Manager.

COMPLIANCE
You must ensure that you read, understand and comply with this policy.
The prevention, detection and reporting of modern slavery in any part of our business or supply chains is the
responsibility of all those working for us or under our control. You are required to avoid any activity that might lead
to, or suggest, a breach of this policy.
You must notify your Line Manager OR the SHEQ Compliance Manager as soon as possible if you believe or
suspect that a conflict with this policy has occurred, or may occur in the future.

You are encouraged to raise concerns about any issue or suspicion of modern slavery in any parts of our business
or supply chains of any supplier tier at the earliest possible stage.
If you believe or suspect a breach of this policy has occurred or that it may occur, you must notify your Line Manager
or Managing Director as soon as possible. You should note that where appropriate, and with the welfare and safety
of local workers as a priority, we will give support and guidance to our suppliers to help them address coercive,
abusive and exploitative work practices in their own business and supply chains.
If you are unsure about whether a particular act, the treatment of workers more generally, or their working
conditions within any tier of our supply chains constitutes any of the various forms of modern slavery, raise it with
your Line Manager or Managing Director.
We aim to encourage openness and will support anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith under this
policy, even if they turn out to be mistaken. We are committed to ensuring no one suffers any detrimental treatment
as a result of reporting in good faith their suspicion that modern slavery of whatever form is or may be taking place
in any part of our own business or in any of our supply chains. Detrimental treatment includes dismissal,
disciplinary action, threats or other unfavourable treatment connected with raising a concern. If you believe that
you have suffered any such treatment, you should inform the compliance manager immediately. If the matter is
not remedied, and you are an employee, you should raise it formally using our Grievance Procedure.

COMMUNICATION & AWARENESS
Training on this policy, and on the risk our business faces from modern slavery in its supply chains, forms part of
the induction process for all individuals who work for us, and regular training will be provided as necessary.
Our zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery must be communicated to all suppliers, contractors and business
partners at the outset of our business relationship with them and reinforced as appropriate thereafter.

POLICY BREACHES
Non- compliance with this policy by employees may result in disciplinary action up to and including summary
dismissal, and by contractors, agents or other third parties working on our behalf, in termination of contract.

Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
The Modern Slavery Act
This statement is made on behalf of the SIMEC Group (SIMEC) pursuant to section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the
Act) and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement and is intended to demonstrate how SIMEC applies its
values in the course of business and highlights the degree to which we view our duty to challenge and confront the use of
forced, compulsory, trafficked or child labour within our own organisation and our supply chains.

SIMEC
SIMEC is an international group of companies that work for tomorrow’s generations as much as for today’s. On a planet of
limited resources, rising population and cycles of prosperity and recession, we place great emphasis on making our
enterprises both resilient and sustainable.
For more than 60 years we’ve operated in sectors that are fundamental to the economy: energy, metals, engineering, logistics,
and more recently infrastructure, financial services, property and mining. We’ve always sought to add value to these industries
by doing things differently, and that remains the prevailing spirit of our companies today.
At the heart of SIMEC’s approach is our focus on integrating and innovating to deliver value throughout the process; from the
renewable energy that enables the recycling and processing of metal in our furnaces and mills, and the precision engineering
in our manufacturing plants, to the industry-friendly financial services that enable trade and invigorate the whole business
environment in which we operate.
With a range of physical assets and human resources spanning over 30 countries and more than 200 sites, our business is
constantly growing and evolving in pursuit of our corporate vision. Our ability to deliver that vision is defined not only by the
size of our operation, but by the quality of our people. We recruit the best, safeguard people and skills, and then invest to
ensure they continue to grow as we do.
We have an industrial heritage that stretches back many decades but more importantly, we have an inspiring vision that
delivers a smarter, more sustainable and viable future for both industry and society. It is a vision that will ensure we continue
to push the boundaries and deliver
for many decades to come.
With resources spanning commodities trading, steel and aluminium manufacturing and recycling capabilities, advanced
engineering, as well as financial and property services, SIMEC is individually owned and managed but collectively offer
decades of expertise that delivers a strong competitive edge across the value chain.
Our principles, policies and code of conduct in respect of combatting slavery and human trafficking
In this world of limited resources, rising population and cycles of prosperity and recession, we need a new model for industry
and a smarter way of using resources. SIMEC has a vision which sees a more sustainable and non--cyclical future for industry
as a foundation for a stronger and more prosperous society.
SIMEC’s mission is to re-establish the pivotal position of metals manufacturing and engineering in the geographical markets
where it operates through using local resources, sustainable energy, investment, technology and skills.
Its strategy for delivery uses its extensive industrial, commodity and financial resources that work together to achieve an
outcome that is larger than the sum of its parts.
We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our
business. Our human rights policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business
relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking are
not taking place any where in our supply chains.
SIMEC aspires to play an important role in the fight against the existence of slavery and human trafficking within the sectors
in which we operate. We are keenly aware of the adverse impacts such practices have on the lives of vulnerable individuals. In
the spirit of our GREENSTEEL philosophy which is based on sustainability and respect, we feel we have a particular duty to

take a lead in upholding human rights through our business practice.
We have zero tolerance of slavery and human trafficking. To ensure all those in our supply chain and contractors comply with
our values we have put in place a number of human rights focused policies.

Our policies
Human rights
In 2018, SIMEC introduced a human rights policy that demonstrates our commitment to combatting human rights abuses and
modern slavery, encompassing internationally-recognised human rights such as those laid out in the International Bill of
Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and
illustrates how we expect to operate across SIMEC. Our human rights policy also sets out our intention to implement the UN
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in all areas of our business and to continually monitor SIMEC’s impact on
human rights.
SIMEC’s human rights policy focuses on the core sectors of our business where we intend to be particularly mindful of our
impact on human rights. In our capacity:
as a goods and services provider we are committed to ensuring that human rights considerations are reflected in our
systems, processes and controls throughout the period of engagement with our customers and cycle of our supply
chain; and we will work with our clients and suppliers to increase their respect for and understanding of human rights as
well as of their potential adverse impacts;
as a purchaser of services, materials and products we are committed to engaging suppliers who respect human rights
and whose principles align with our own; and to working in cooperation with our suppliers to broaden their
understanding of human rights and to ensure their commitment to respecting human rights; and
as a global business: we are committed to treating all of our employees fairly, and without discrimination, whilst
providing safe working conditions which respect their human rights. We are also opposed to any form of forced,
compulsory, trafficked or child labour in either our own business or that of our supply chains.
The human rights policy encourages all employees to raise any concerns, questions or grievances, and requires them to report
any known or suspected violations of applicable laws, regulations, policies or ethics. Any concerns related to human rights
internally or in our supply chain including forced compulsory, trafficked or child labour is to be reported in accordance with our
whistleblowing policy.

Whistle-blowing
In support of the human rights policy, SIMEC has also introduced a whistle-blowing policy to allow potential breaches of
human rights and modern slavery concerns to be escalated and handled in a confidential and sensitive manner.

Suppliers and vendors
Prior to engaging with third party vendors or suppliers, we endeavour to screen for human rights breaches as part of our
onboarding process.
SIMEC has produced a supplier charter, which-stipulates the standards expected of our suppliers, providing them with a
principle-based approach on how we expect them to conduct business within both their own operations and within their own
supply chains.
The supplier charter has five main tenets and requires that all of our suppliers should:
not hold another person in any form of slavery, or employ, engage or otherwise use forced, compulsory or child labour,
as well as reframing from using any abusive or inhumane treatment of any of their employees;
not act, or fail to act, in such a way that they would directly or indirectly adversely impact the human rights of any
individual or third party;
comply with all applicable employment and diversity laws, including with regard to recruitment, retention and promotion
of employees;
comply with all health and safety laws and provide a safe working environment for all employees; and
report any breach of the supplier charter and to take reasonable steps to redress, remedy and prevent any further
breaches of the supplier charter.

KPIs
The implementation of our human rights policy, supplier charter, whistle blowing policy, external vendor and supplier
onboarding policy are the 2018 steps taken as part of our mission to, create a series of underlying principles, systems and
processes to systematically address modern slavery throughout SIMEC and our supply chains.

Training
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our
business, we endeavour to provide training to our staff. SIMEC recognises that the knowledge, responsibility and conduct of
our staff play an important role in mitigating the risk of slavery and human trafficking within our organisation.

Approval
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes SIMEC’s slavery and human
trafficking statement for the financial year ending 2017.

•

•

•

•
•

During 2019, Dechra has continued to make employees aware of the principles in the Code of
Conduct and How to Raise a Concern Procedure in order to maintain the highest standards of
employee conduct and ethical behaviour throughout its business and in managing its supply

Introduction
This statement is made on behalf of Vivo Energy plc and its aff iliates carrying on a
business in the UK (“Vivo Energy”) pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery
Act 2015.

About the business
Vivo Energy is a leading retailer and marketer of Shell-branded fuels and
lubricants in Af rica. It operates in 23 countries across North, West, East and
Southern Af rica, marketing its products to retail customers through its network of
more than 2,250 Shell and Engen branded service stations, and to commercial
customers through its commercial fuels and lubricants business.

Combatting modern slavery
Vivo Energy strongly supports the elimination of all forms of modern slavery. Such
exploitation is entirely at odds with our core values of honesty, integrity and
respect for people. These values are crucial to our success and growth, and to
achieving our vision of becoming Af rica’s most respected energy business.
We have developed a clear set of principles, policies and manuals to communicate
how and why we do business the right way. Respect for human rights is
embedded in the Vivo Energy Code of Conduct and the General Business
Principles, which recognise a responsibility to conduct business as responsible
corporate members of society and to support fundamental human rights in line

with the legitimate role of business. Both the Code and the Business Principles
explicitly address our commitment to combatting modern slavery and human
traff icking.
Compliance with both the Code of Conduct and our General Business Principles is
mandatory for all staff. Moreover, they also articulate the expectations we apply to
those with whom we do business, and whether or not a contractor or supplier acts
consistently with these values and standards is an important factor in the decision
whether to enter into or remain in business relationships.
We have developed specif ic measures to address the risk of modern slavery
arising in parts of our business and supply chains that we consider represent a
higher risk. For example, we have developed a compliance statement that we
require certain business partners to sign which communicates our expectations
on modern slavery, requires the business partner to conf irm they are not aware of
any instances of modern slavery linked to their business, and requests that they
take steps to communicate our expectations to any sub-contractors or agents
with which they engage. We have obtained signed compliance statements f rom
our retailers as we recognise that this also represents a higher risk in terms of
modern slavery. We are also in the process of expressly embedding these
requirements in our contracts with key business partners and suppliers.

Entities covered under our modern slavery statement
(https: //www.vivoenergy.com/Portals/1/Documents/ModernSlaveryStatement/LIST%20O
%20VE%20MSS.pdf?ver=2019-09-25-134212-817&timestamp=1569415306675)

Due Diligence processes
Due diligence and KYC screening takes place, in line with the VE KYC Policy,
before any Vivo Energy entity enters into a binding commercial contract with a
high risk third party. The process of identifying and verifying the identity of our
business partners endeavour to use global best practices including the use of
reliable and independent risk database screening tools, documents, data and / or
information where necessary. This includes an evaluation of whether a potential
business partner may be involved in any illegal or corrupt practices.

Training
Mandatory all-staff training courses covering the Code of Conduct, Combating
Modern Slavery Guidance and our Business Principles are generally provided on a
bi-annual basis, and new joiners are required to complete this training within
three months of joining Vivo Energy. Our training material specif ically address the
risk of modern slavery, in order to better inform our employees about identifying
warning signs and how to escalate concerns.

Reporting of concerns
Vivo Energy provides employees with safe and conf idential channels to raise
concerns and report instances of non-compliance with our Code of Conduct or
Business Principles. In turn, Vivo Energy expects its employees and counterparties

to report suspected breaches.
The Vivo Energy Global Helpline is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to all
employees and contract staff in Vivo Energy and for third parties with whom Vivo
has a business relationship (such as customers, suppliers, agents) if they observe
wrongdoing or wish to raise concerns, in full conf idence and without fear of
retaliation. Once a report has been made, the report is passed to the Vivo Energy
Compliance Off ice for appropriate assessment and if necessary, an investigation
team will be assigned. Regular campaigns are launched via posters and
screensavers to raise awareness of the option to report concerns without fear of
victimisation. A specif ic reporting category has been included in the
whistleblowing helpline in order to ensure that modern slavery concerns are
promptly identif ied and escalated to the Head of Ethics and Compliance.
A special campaign was launched to place whistleblowing helpline posters at all
our retail sites so that not only our staff is aware of the need to report a concern
but also the staff of the retailers and or a third party witnessing any concerns.
Mandatory all staff training was rolled out to raise more awareness on how to
report a concern and what sort of concerns need to be reported.
Dedicated awareness campaigns are also rolled out on an annual basis to keep
this current and relevant for our staff members.

Looking forward
Our enduring commitment to Vivo Energy’s values means that we will continue to
seek ways in which we might improve our capacity to identify and deal with
modern slavery risks in all aspects of our business and supply chains.

Approval
This statement has been approved by the board of directors of Vivo Energy plc for
and on behalf of Vivo Energy.

We trained relevant colleagues to understand the subject.2 Aileen Robinson[https://wikirate.org/Aileen_Robinson].....2021-04-08 14:58:14 UTC","Modern Slavery & Human Trafficking Statement
The Modern Slavery Act of 2015 requires businesses to produce a statement regarding the steps
the organisation has taken during the year to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not
taking place in any of its supply chains, nor in any part of its own business. This is our third
annual statement.
What is Modern Slavery?
Slavery as many of us understand it was abolished years ago, and the idea that someone owns
someone else is abhorrent to current thinking. However, a new type of slavery exists in the
modern world. Inequality is growing and the global labour market is in some areas multi-national,
with many people crossing borders to look for work. People can be coerced into working against
their will for little or no recompense through means such as paying off debts, by companies
retaining identity papers and by false promises.
There are far too many people in the world being still treated as commodities and being
exploited. The Modern Slavery Act would like us all to do our part in mitigating this issue.
JoJo Maman Bébé has always put ethical business practices and policies at the heart of
everything we do. As a certified B-corp we are proud to put our ethics at the heart of the
business and we firmly believe in our mantra of putting people and the planet ahead of profit
whilst being a commercially viable business. We have always tried to make the best product we
can in the most responsible way. We welcome this act that encourages businesses to be
transparent in how they deal with their own staff and suppliers; it will encourage due diligence
and raise awareness to protect vulnerable people.
Who are we?
JoJo Maman Bébé was founded in 1993 by Laura Tenison MBE and has grown to become the
UK’s leading mother and baby multi-channel boutique brand. We design and retail high quality,
imaginative, practical clothing and products for pregnant women and families with young
children. We currently have 90+ stores across the UK, Republic of Ireland and the USA, strong
ecommerce websites, a growing, loyal customer base and wholesale partners that connect us to
over 40 countries worldwide.
The company now employs nearly 1000 team members, approximately 100 in our London
design & marketing studio, around 175 in our head office and distribution centre in South Wales
and the remainder spread across our local high street stores across the UK, Eire and the East
coast of America.
How can we ensure that there is no modern slavery within our UK team and business?
We all have a responsibility to be aware of the risks, however small, in our UK business and
those suppliers who support our UK operations. We have a clear process and policy to ensure
that people joining our team do so of their own free will and have trained colleagues to be alert to
risk factors. There is a clear mandate to report any concerns and for management to act upon
them.
Where and how do we make what we sell?
The Modern Slavery Act requires us to be transparent about our supply chain. “Supply Chain” is
the catchall phrase to describe the people and companies who help us make and sell our
products. For example, not only the factories we work directly with to make our items – e.g. a
baby dress factory (first tier), but also their suppliers – they may be supplied by a company that
prints the fabric (second tier), who in turn is supplied by a company that weaves the fabric (third
tier), who is supplied by a company that cleans and makes the yarn (fourth tier) all the way down
to the farmer that grows the cotton. Furthermore, the supply chain may include the transporters
who ship the finished goods to us, and the courier who brings you the parcel.
JoJo Maman Bébé is both a manufacturer as well as a retailer – we design all our beautiful styles

and products in London but we make them all over the world with specialist factories.
Additionally, we purchase some items from key third party brands.
We have over 125 primary factories who make our designs for us. We tend to work directly with
the factories wherever possible, rather than through a middle person, as this gives us more
transparency and direct communication. We firmly believe in building long term relationships with
the factories. Some have worked with us for around 20 years, growing as we have, sharing the
journey together and becoming friends.
We make things worldwide but focus on countries with higher standards that give us confidence
in the ethics of the factory as well as their ability to produce the quality of goods we require.
These are mostly in China, India and Turkey.
We have an established process to check and monitor new and current suppliers. Suppliers are
regularly audited. Our audit is based on the Ethical Trade Initiative (ETI) Base Code with
additional areas specific to our market. The ETI Base Code covers core areas of employee
rights; such as access to unions, not allowing child labour, ensuring hours of work are not
unreasonable, that minimum wages are met or exceeded, that the employee works in a safe
place etc. alongside environmental and other concerns. The ETI Base Code has been updated
to cover all aspects of tackling modern slavery or human trafficking - in particular identifying how
the employee came to the business and we have incorporated this into our codes and audits.
The JoJo Maman Bébé team travel regularly to our factories to see for themselves our items
being developed and produced. We audit the factories in person. We work with third party
auditors to complement our own audits, but we prefer to develop personal relationships with the
factories we work with, growing business together and jointly improving quality, production
processes and standards as needed. We also work with organisations dedicated to improving
ethical business practices and support our factories to become accredited within them.
What can we do about modern slavery?
We trust our suppliers to work to our ethical code, and we know they would be horrified to think
of employing someone against their will, however modern slavery may be something they are not
even aware of. A key focus of our approach is to work with our factories to find ways to not only
check this is not happening, but to train them to identify potential risk areas within their own
business.
We can also train our teams to understand the business needs of the supplier and how our
requirements could impact negatively on their own staffing processes and ensure we work
together to mitigate this.
What have we done about modern slavery?
We made our first modern slavery statement in July 2016 which detailed the changes the
business had made since the introduction of the act in October 2015 including confirming a
company policy on the subject and updating paperwork such as our audits and supplier
guidelines. We trained relevant colleagues to understand the subject and moreover, we opened
dialogue with suppliers on understanding the risk in their businesses. Having previously been
focused on our primary tier one suppliers we began the process of mapping additional second
and third tier suppliers. In our second year we focused on engaging key suppliers to understand
their approach to recruitment and the risks of slavery and we expanded our supply mapping
further down the tiers and into other areas of the business to include suppliers who were not
making stock.
In this financial year of July 2017-June 2018 we have continued to focus on the issue and have
taken the following steps:
1) Continued updating our supplier audit database to include modern slavery risk assessments,
85% of Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers have been assessed at a deeper level.

2) Completed updating our grading methodology to incorporate MSA risk indicators.
3) Brought key non-stock suppliers into the audit process and reporting.
4) Surveyed our top 20 suppliers to assess their understanding of risk within their business
following on from visits last year to engage on the subject. Identified areas for further training to
be rolled out in the next financial year.
5) Visited 54 of our suppliers, who together supplied nearly 80% of our stock for the year. Our inhouse team conducted new audits including more in depth recruitment assessments to highlight
modern slavery risk factors.
JoJo Maman Bébé has always followed a code of honesty and openness with our suppliers, we
view them as partners and intend to work with them to do our part to mitigate this global issue.

Agrial Fresh Produce Ltd. Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement for the Financial Year ending
December 2017
Introduction from the Managing Director
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out the steps
which Agrial Fresh Produce Ltd. has taken in this financial year to combat slavery and human trafficking.
Agrial Fresh Produce Ltd. has always been committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking in our
supply chains. Taking these steps has strengthened our resolve still further and the tools it provides us with
will empower us to do more than ever before in pursuit of this goal.
Our Business
Agrial Fresh Produce Ltd. is a food manufacturer in the fresh produce sector. We are part of Agrial, a French
owned co-operative group. Agrial Fresh Produce operates across 4 sites in the UK employing circa 1000
people.
Our business supplies prepared salad and beetroot products to customers within the retail, convenience,
food service and business to business sectors of the UK & European market. Our actual business units are
based in the UK but products are sourced both within the UK and internationally, mainly within continental
European countries.
Our Supply Chain
Agrial Fresh Produce Ltd works closely with their growers with many long-established relationships. All
primary suppliers are SEDEX registered. We also work with suppliers accredited by Global GAP. Suppliers
work with us in partnership to proactively ensure all appropriate measures are taken. They have a code of
conduct they must adhere to.
As temporary and seasonal work is common practice within our supply chain it is an area that we have
identified as a potential risk for slavery and human trafficking. Working in partnership with the GLAA
(Gangmasters Labour Abuse Authority), ALP (Association of Labour Providers) and Stronger Together helps
us support our growers and employees throughout our supply chain to minimise the risk of exploitation.
As a Company we have a robust supplier approval process which involves ethical audits to ensure our
supplier’s ethical stance is aligned with ours. We audit compliance in line with the ETI (Ethical Trading
Initiative) Base Code. Our aim is to have transparency throughout the supply chain.
Our Policies on Slavery and Human Trafficking
We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or
in any part of our business. Our Ethical Sourcing Policy, based on the ETI Base Code reflects our
commitment to ensuring all labour is employed ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships.
April 2018
Page 1

This includes the implementation and enforcement of effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and
human trafficking are not taking place anywhere in our supply chains.
Due Diligence Processes for Slavery and Human Trafficking
We have put in place systems to:
·
Identify and assess potential risk areas in our supply chains.
·
Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our supply chains.
·
Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains.
We are operating in a sector that has a relatively high risk of slavery and human trafficking. We mitigate
this risk by developing long standing sustainable relationships with our accredited suppliers. As part of the
Agrial Group many of these suppliers are integrated into the supply chain as part of the wider Company. By
working closely with UK suppliers and carrying out ethical audits we minimize the risk occurring. In 2017
UK growers, including those with SMETA audits in place, were visited and audited by the HR teams as part
of our due diligence. The HR Managers have undertaken an external accredited auditing course to enable
them to carry out these audits in a fair, transparent and comprehensive manner. Any non-conformances
were then discussed and in partnership, suppliers were helped to resolve any issues.
By working in conjunction with Stronger Together and GLAA and promoting their posters, visual aids and
helplines on site, we offer a confidential service so that people can raise concerns about slavery and human
trafficking in our supply chains. All temporary labour supplied to our sites will be via an employment agency
that is registered with the GLAA. In 2017 regular worker interviews took place with agency workers to
ensure any potential risk of exploitation from traffickers could be determined.
Supplier Adherence to Our Values
Agrial Fresh Produce Ltd expects all suppliers and any subcontractor engaged by the Company to respect
and conform to our fundamental values as conditions for mutual business.
We have zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking. We require our immediate suppliers to inform us
what steps they are taking to monitor the risk of slavery and human trafficking further down the supply
chain. We will not support or deal with any supplier knowingly involved in slavery or human trafficking.
Training
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply
chains and our business, we provide training to our staff. All Directors, Managers and Supervisors in the
business have undergone Modern Slavery awareness training. HR team members have also attended GLAA
(Gangmaster Labour Abuse Authority) and Stronger Together workshops. The Works Councils on all sites
have had a GLAA awareness session.
All employees are expected to be alert to the risks, however small, in our business and in the wider supply
chain. Employees are encouraged to report concerns and management are expected to act upon them.

Further Steps
Following a review of the effectiveness of the steps we have taken to ensure that there is no slavery or
human trafficking in our supply chains we intend to take the following further steps to combat slavery and
human trafficking:
• We will continue to work with our agency suppliers to carry out audits, with agency workers
being randomly interviewed to ensure no risk of exploitation.
• We will carry out worker audits with our own employees to ensure they are not at risk from
external exploitation
• Ethical audits will continue to take place via a risk based approach, which will be extended to
include non-produce suppliers, to ensure that standards are met.
• A copy of this statement will be shared with all suppliers.

Modern Slavery Act Transpatency Statement
Hitachi Europe Limited
Modern Slavery Act 2015 Statement for the year ending 31 March 2020
Hitachi Europe recognises the importance of identifying and preventing modern slavery and its causes in our business and supply chain. This statement, our fifth
made pursuant to Section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, sets out the steps we have taken to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in our business
and supply chain in the year ending 31 March 2020 as well as our plans for the current year. It covers Hitachi Europe Limited only. For other Hitachi Group
company statements please see the relevant company website or visit www.hitachi.eu/en-gb/modern-slavery-act.

Our Business
Hitachi Europe is part of the Hitachi Group and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hitachi, Ltd. in Japan. Our business in the UK is headquartered in
Maidenhead, with significant presences in London and Cambridge. We also have branch offices in Istanbul (Turkey), Warsaw (Poland), Zurich
(Switzerland), Johannesburg (South Africa) and Copenhagen (Denmark), and a representative office in Bucharest (Romania). These offices are involved
in sales and/or business development.
Operations
Our Maidenhead office operates as the European corporate centre for Hitachi, Ltd. providing support and services to Hitachi’s European Group
companies and, along with our other UK based locations, also houses a number of diverse businesses, which are organised in operational business
groups supplying a variety of products and services under the Hitachi brand. In the financial year ending 31 March 2020 these included:
• The Digital Media Group – sources and sells televisions, soundbars, refrigerators and motion sensors. Consumer products are available in the UK via
retailers such as Argos;
• The Security Business Group – focusses on digital security solutions and finger vein technology, a secure, simple and safe way for banks to identify
their customers by reading their unique vein pattern;
• The Power Device Division – provides advanced high reliability semiconductors – including insulated gate bipolar transistors, integrated circuits and
diodes – to industrial, rail, automotive and consumer markets. These components deliver high power efficiency for precise electric power control, in
applications ranging from motors to grid level power transmission;
• The Particle Beam Therapy Group – provides systems to deliver proton therapy, one of the most advanced forms of cancer therapy available, offering
treatment with pinpoint accuracy and minimal side effects;
• The Digital Solutions Group – offers digital solutions, combining Hitachi's extensive operational technology and advanced IT capability to meet client
needs in areas including connected communities, energy management and electric mobility; and
• The Social Innovation Business Group - is responsible for developing new digital solutions that harness Hitachi’s extensive experience in IT and
operational technologies to bring new value to our customers. Activities are focused on delivering solutions in three core areas of expertise: Transport,
Manufacturing and Smart Energy
We also provide corporate, administrative, compliance and governance services to other Hitachi Group companies. Our UK business, and its overseas
branch and representative offices, employs approximately 420 people. In the 2019 financial year, Hitachi Europe had a turnover of approximately £154
million.

Our Supply Chain
We have approximately 50 active trade suppliers (of which 14 are Hitachi Group companies) that supply either complete products or components of our
products. Half of these are based in the UK or Japan. A review of our suppliers in 2019 indicated one fifth of our trade suppliers are based in countries
identified as posing a high risk of modern slavery, namely China (including Hong Kong), Greece, Malaysia, Thailand and Turkey. The others are based in
other lower risk European countries, Australia, Singapore and the US.

We have approximately 1200 further suppliers which are categorised as non-trade. They supply everything used for our operations that is not a product
or product component. The majority of these suppliers are located in the UK and Japan, while a small number are based in higher risk countries
including China, Egypt, India, Oman, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
Our Approach
We are committed to conducting business ethically and to minimising the risk of slavery or human trafficking in our own business and in our supply
chains.
Our commitment and work is strongly supported by Hitachi, Ltd. In 2019, Hitachi, Ltd.'s President and CEO, Toshiaki Higashihara, signed the World
Business Council for Sustainable Development’s CEO Guide to Human Rights calling for CEOs to go beyond compliance to drive transformative
change in corporate respect for human rights.
In line with Hitachi’s global human rights approach to create a value chain where the human rights of all stakeholders are respected, Hitachi Europe
seeks to work with suppliers that actively address modern slavery and to work collaboratively with those still developing their processes in this area. We
also strive to engage employees and other Hitachi Group companies in understanding why addressing modern slavery is important and how to identify
and act on indicators of slavery.
Our four key areas of focus in addressing modern slavery are (1) implementing Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD), (2) raising awareness and
building expertise in Hitachi Europe and across the Hitachi Group in Europe, (3) collaborating with external organisations and stakeholders, and (4)
monitoring progress.
Hitachi Europe’s HRDD process is in line with that outlined in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We seek to:
assess where human rights and modern slavery risks exist, the severity and likelihood of impact, and to prioritise the order in which we will address
them;
integrate and act on the findings of our assessments;
track progress to ensure our actions are effective; and
communicate outcomes appropriately to relevant stakeholders.
We acknowledge that we are on a journey and, in common with other companies, face challenges which include engaging suppliers where we have low
leverage and fully understanding the sub-tiers of our supply chain. This is why we collaborate with external stakeholders and experts to overcome such
challenges and ensure that our work is robust and effective.
Our Policies
We continue to apply our company and Group policies which address issues relevant to slavery and human trafficking:
The Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct (LINK) refer to respecting human rights, in particular hiring employees according to international standards and not engaging in child or
forced labour.
The Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy (LINK) sets out Hitachi’s commitment to undertake Human Rights Due Diligence in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles to
identify and address human rights issues, including those related to modern slavery.
The Hitachi Group CSR Procurement Guideline (LINK) is shared with suppliers and specifically calls for freely chosen employment, appropriate working ages, working hours,
wages and benefits as well as humane treatment, non-discrimination and freedom of association.
Our written employment practices and procedures ensure fair recruitment and treatment of employees.
A written whistleblowing procedure encourages employees to report concerns of malpractice, which would include any concerns related to modern slavery and human
trafficking issues.

Our Progress to date
Over the last year, we have:
1. Continued to implement Human Rights Due Diligence
We reviewed and updated our Supplier Self-Assessment Questionnaire; and
we drafted questions on modern slavery and human trafficking to be included in the supplier onboarding process with the objective of raising
red flags at the outset.

2. Raised awareness and built expertise
We continued to co-ordinate a cross-group European Responsible Supply Chain Working Group co-led by our Sustainability and Value Chain
Integration teams. All Hitachi Group companies in Europe are invited to join this collective learning group which aims to support Group
companies in strengthening their consideration of social impacts within their supply chains, and specifically to:
1. increase the understanding of Hitachi’s approach as set out in the Hitachi Group’s Human Rights Policy and with reference to drivers for
implementing the UN Guiding Principles, such as the regulatory environment in Europe in relation to business and human rights
including the UK Modern Slavery Act;
2. build capacity in understanding how salient human rights issues in the supply chain can be assessed and prioritised;
3. build capacity in managing challenges and identified salient human rights risks proactively;
4. equip group companies with the knowledge, guidance and tools on how to embed human rights due diligence with suppliers; and
5. provide an information exchange platform among Hitachi companies in Europe to discuss challenges and good practice.
Our modern slavery e-learning module was made mandatory for all Hitachi Europe employees.
3. Collaborated with external organisations and stakeholders
We continued to participate in:
The UN Global Compact’s UK Modern Slavery Working Group (MSWG). We have benefited from cross-sector learning, including
presentations and discussion with the Slavery & Trafficking Risk Template Committee.
BSR (Business for Social Responsibility), a global not for profit organisation, participating in their Human Rights Working Group. We took
part in peer learning, openly discussing challenges and solutions.
techUK’s Sustainable Supply Chain group, providing access to learning from peers in the technology sector on modern slavery.
We participated in modern slavery statement peer review exercises facilitated by the UNGC MSWG and techUK, feeding learning across
Hitachi Group companies.
We collaborated with Shift, the business and human rights experts, to input into and guide the direction of the European Responsible Supply
Chain Working Group.
4. Monitoring progress
We continue to work towards the development of KPIs. However, we have continued to focus on ensuring we have the right processes in place and
fully understand the risks in our supply chain before we set and agree KPIs.
Our Future Plans
Over the coming year and beyond we plan to focus on the following areas:
Implementing Human Rights Due Diligence
Further develop the risk analysis of our suppliers and increase awareness with key suppliers as appropriate.
Add questions on modern slavery and human trafficking within the supplier onboarding process.
Raising awareness and building expertise
The plans for the Human Rights Working Group for relevant procurement and CSR colleagues in Hitachi Group companies in Europe will
build on the FY19 focus on preventing and mitigating Supply Chain Social Risks in practice. The working group will consider how to rollout the self-assessment questionnaire to suppliers and analyse the returned self-assessment questionnaires.
Collaborating with external organisations and stakeholders
Continue membership of techUK’s Sustainable Supply Chain Group.
Monitoring progress
We will continue to assess the feasibility of setting effective KPIs to monitor progress.

Hitachi Nuclear Energy Europe, Limited
Modern Slavery Act 2015 Statement 2018-2019
Hitachi Nuclear Energy Europe, Limited recognises the importance of identifying and preventing the action and causes of modern slavery in our business and supply chain. This
statement, our fourth made under Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, sets out the steps we have taken to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in our business
and supply chain in the year to 31 March 2019.

Our Business
Hitachi Nuclear Energy Europe, Limited is part of the Hitachi Group and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hitachi, Ltd. in Japan. The business in the UK was
headquartered in London and had a substantial presence in Gloucester. The business employed around 80 permanent members of staff and had a turnover in the
2018/2019 financial year of approximately £111 million.
During the period to which this statement relates, the business provided management and delivery of UK and European nuclear power generation facilities, and we
contracted with a Hitachi subsidiary, Horizon Nuclear Power, for work on its nuclear new build project at Wylfa Newydd (on the Isle of Anglesey, in North Wales).

On 17 January 2019 Horizon announced that it was suspending its nuclear new build activities, including the Wylfa Newydd project. As a result, Hitachi Nuclear
Energy Europe, Limited has decided to wind down its business to a dormant state and had largely achieved this by 31 March 2019. We do not currently anticipate
any active business during the financial year commencing 1 April 2019.
Our Supply Chain
In the year to 31 March 2019 we had approximately 60 trade suppliers (of which around 13 were Hitachi Group companies) and more than 75 non-trade suppliers.
These agreements have now been terminated.
Our Policies
We were committed to conducting business ethically and to minimising the risk of slavery or human trafficking in our own business and in our supply chains as much
as possible.
Whilst trading, we referred to the company and Group policies which address issues relevant to modern slavery and human trafficking and which included:
the Hitachi Group Codes of Conduct
the Hitachi Group Human Rights Policy
the Hitachi Guidelines for Procurement Activities
written employment practices and procedures which ensure fair recruitment and treatment of employees
a written whistleblowing procedure to encourage employees to report concerns of malpractice, which would include any concerns related to modern slavery and
human trafficking issues.
Our Progress to Date
In the last financial year we took the following steps to address the issue of modern slavery:
1. Improved supply chain assessment and communication
we continued to use an “on boarding” tool to help carry out due diligence on new suppliers to identify if there was any risk of modern slavery being present. The
tool provided regular updates on our existing suppliers so that we were notified of any potential modern slavery issues and could use this to minimise future risks;
our procurement processes ensured that contracts included specific provisions relating to offences under the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
2. Continued to collaborate with external organisations and stakeholders
Hitachi Europe Limited (our affiliate) has continued to participate in, or be a member of, the UN Global Compact’s UK Modern Slavery Working Group, CSR
Europe’s Human Rights Groups, BSR (Business for Social Responsibility), SHIFT’s Business Learning Program and TechUK’s Sustainable Supply Chain group.
These activities are undertaken for the benefit all Hitachi Group companies in Europe, including Hitachi Nuclear Energy Europe, Limited, and help Group
companies to remain up to date on best practice and to benefit from stakeholder input.

Our Future Plans
Given the suspended state of the project, Hitachi Nuclear Energy Europe, Limited will not be trading for the foreseeable future. Should the business be revived we
will continue to take steps to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chains.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes Hitachi Nuclear Energy Europe, Limited’s slavery and human
trafficking statement for the financial year ended 31 March 2019. It has been approved by Hitachi Nuclear Energy Europe, Limited’s Board of Directors.

Modern Slavery Statement
Background
This statement is made on behalf of the UK subsidiaries of Solvay S.A. of Belgium (‘Solvay’) for the financial year ending 31
December 2019. This includes: 1. Solvay Interox Limited (01005238);
2. Solvay Solutions UK Limited (00036833);
3. Cytec Engineered Materials Limited (02851421);
4. Cytec Industrial Materials (Derby) Limited (02264869);
5. Cytec Industrial Materials (Manchester) Limited (00605214);
6. Cytec Process Materials (Keighley) Limited (01472714); and
7. Cytec – Med – Lab Limited (00540182)
This statement is made under the provisions of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the ‘Act’) and with reference to the guidelines
issued from time to time by the Home Office. It sets forth steps taken by Solvay during the financial year to minimise the risk of
any slavery or human trafficking, (together, ‘Modern Slavery’), taking place in any part of its own business or in any of its supply
chains. Modern Slavery encompasses slavery, servitude, human trafficking and forced labour.
Solvay is strongly committed to ethical behavior, sustainable development and responsible care in order to respond as a corporate
citizen to the major challenges facing society and the communities in which Solvay operates.

Our commitment to combatting Modern Slavery
Solvay is committed to acting ethically, and to maintaining a fair and honest business environment for its employees, customers,
suppliers and the public in general. This includes a commitment to respecting and supporting human rights with regard to its
employees, the communities in which it operates and its business partners as expressed in the internationally recognized
standards, many of which are referenced in Solvay’s policies. Solvay operates a number of initiatives to combat Modern Slavery
which are further explained below.
The Solvay Code of Business Integrity ( https://www.solvay.com/sites/g/files/srpend221/files/202001/Code%20of%20Business%20Integrity%20UK.pdf ) explains the manner in which Solvay behaves as an organisation and
how all employees are expected to act wherever Solvay operates or conducts its business. The Solvay Code of Business Integrity
focuses on both integrity and ethics. Solvay’s ‘Ethics and Integrity in Society as a Corporate Citizen’ firmly establishes Solvay’s
commitment to respect human rights and to respect internationally recognized human rights standards and conventions, including
the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of which Solvay is a member signatory. The exclusion of child
exploitation is explicitly recognized as a human rights standard applicable in Solvay’s operations and in its value chain. Solvay
does not tolerate the employment of child or forced labour and will take counter-measures to prevent human and/or sex
trafficking. Solvay expects and requires that all of its business partners will respect and support these fundamental principles in
the same manner.
As signatory to the worldwide agreement with the IndustriALL Global Union, Solvay further commits to safeguard human rights by
respecting international social standards as defined by the International Labour Organization, commits to comply with the
principles of the United Nations Global Compact and commits to respect the OECD’s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.
Solvay is committed to creating stable and reliable relationships with its suppliers based on shared values. Solvay has adopted a
Supplier Code of Conduct (https://www.solvay.com/sites/g/files/srpend221/files/tridion/documents/Supplier-Code-ofConduct_en.pdf ) which requires the written commitment of its suppliers to follow the Solvay Code of Conduct or to abide by
their own code of conduct, as Solvay is determined to work only with suppliers who are engaged with similar ethical principles
including those to combat Modern Slavery.
The ‘Solvay Purchasing Process’ underlines Solvay’s expectation of its suppliers and sub-contractors to respect Solvay’s
fundamental principles of sustainability (for further information, see https://www.solvay.com/sites/g/files/srpend221/files/201807/SPP_Handbook_2016-Reference.pdf ). This Solvay Purchasing Process also covers rigorous supplier assessments and
selection methodology, including corporate social responsibility criteria. These commitments and expectations have recently

selection methodology, including corporate social responsibility criteria. These commitments and expectations have recently
been summarized in Solvay’s Responsible Sourcing and Sustainable Supply Chain Statement which can be viewed at:
https://www.solvay.com/sites/g/files/srpend221/files/201807/Responsible_Purchasing_and_Sustainable_Supply_Chain_Statement.pdf . As a founding member of the Together for
Sustainability (the ‘TfS’) initiative established by multinational leading chemical companies, Solvay has joined forces to develop
and implement a global supplier engagement program that assesses and audits sustainability sourcing practices through an
independent process.
The Solvay Corporate Social Responsibility framework (the ‘Solvay Way’) firmly establishes the organisation’s approach to
corporate social responsibility and sustainability. The Solvay Way is aligned with the ISO 26000 standard (which amongst others
includes the elimination of child labor and forced labor as recognized basic human rights) and highlights Solvay’s drive for
continuous improvement in its corporate social responsibility.
To further improve the efficiency of its compliance management system, Solvay operates a whistleblowing platform called ‘Speak
Up’ to allow employees to raise concerns about how colleagues are being treated, or practices within the business or supply chain
or any observed or suspected violations of the law or of Solvay’s policies. Such reports are wholly confidential and any employee
who makes a report in good faith will be protected from retaliation. Mandatory awareness and training campaigns regarding
applicable legal rules and the policies in force in the Solvay Group, including topics such as human rights are deployed for all
employees.
Solvay endeavours to comply with all laws and regulations in effect in the jurisdictions in which it operates and to go beyond legal
compliance when needed to meet the high ethical and moral standards reflected in our commitment to combatting modern slavery
and human trafficking and in our commitment to corporate social responsibility.

Solvay’s Response to Covid-19
As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, Solvay has put in place dedicated global and country teams responsible for assessing and
implementing government measures, recommendations and guidelines to best protect its employees and the local communities
where it operates, and to ensure business continuity.
In line with those measures, Solvay has made remote working mandatory for all employees who can effectively work from home.
In regards to industrial operations, Solvay has established rigorous health and safety restrictions. In particular:
Solvay plants have put in place robust continuity plans, which include health education, hygienic practices and stringent
epidemic prevention measures;
Solvay has restricted access to its plants. Only individuals whose presence is necessary for operations are permitted on site,
and their health is regularly monitored;
Both broad and targeted communications are carried out within Solvay to increase awareness, discipline for personal
protection and early reporting of suspicious symptoms;
Where employees cannot work effectively from home, strong measures have been taken to observe social distancing and
large gatherings are strictly forbidden;
Additionally, many of Solvay’s sites have doctors and medical advisors who are available to guide Solvay employees and
address questions.
Solvay UK sites have undertaken risk assessments in line with UK government and HSE guidance to ensure the health and
safety of employees in the workplace.
Last, but not least, in addition hereto, Solvay has created the Solvay Solidarity Fund to provide additional support, both financial
and non-financial, to any employee and dependents who may experience hardship due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

Ltd and its subsidiaries for the Financial Year ended 31st
March 2019
E-ppl Holdings Ltd Modern Slavery Statement is made pursuant to Section 54 of the Modern Slavery
Act 2015 “Transparency in Supply Chains”. This statement sets out the steps that E-ppl Holdings Ltd
have taken to address the risk of slavery taking place within its own operations and supply chains
and how we plan to continually improve our approach.

Business Sector
Our group of companies which includes E-ppl, Autoscan and Simmerson Associates support OEM’s
and their supply chains predominantly in the Automotive sector with their vehicle projects and
quality performance through a varied number of managed services.
An intrinsic part of the service we provide to our customers is our people and we strive to operate
with the highest standards of ethics and responsibility towards our employees and workers and do
all that we can to ensure that our supply base operate in the same way.

Organisational Structure
Due to the nature of our customers requirements and the vehicles that they manufacture our
support to them is highly reactive which means our manning at any one time can change
dramatically flexing from between 350 to 1200 personnel at any one time. We support in many
areas throughout the UK at our customers premises and the business code of conduct that we instill
in all of our employees is adopted throughout. We require all colleagues to act with integrity and be
vigilant against human rights abuses and actively encourage the importance of raising any concerns
to management.
We have a cross-functional working group under the sponsorship of the Group CEO which includes
participation from Operations, Commercial, Recruitment and Human Resources to help in tackling
modern day slavery and human trafficking within our business and our supply base.
This Group meets on a regular basis to discuss and take action in the following areas;
•
•
•
•
•

Identifying areas of risk within our business and the supply chain
Taking appropriate steps to mitigate those risks
Developing an ongoing programme to continually improve our response to slavery and
human trafficking risk
Monitoring the ongoing effectiveness of our risk prevention
The protection and encouragement of whistleblowers

Whilst we recognize that no business is immune to the risks of modern slavery, we believe that by
having a standardized and robust set of policies and procedures throughout the Group we can help
to minimize the risk to our workforce.
Policies
Recruitment Policy
The purpose of this policy is to provide a sound framework for the recruitment and selection of staff
based upon the principles outlined below whilst also meeting the requirements of Equal
Opportunities, the Equality Act 2010 and all other employment regulation and our policy ensures we
will;
•
•
•

Be fair and consistent
Be non-discriminatory
Conform to all regulations and agreed best practice

E-ppl Group companies undertake “right to work” checks and DBS checks with all employees prior to
commencement of roles with the company ensuring where necessary valid work visas are in place
and appropriate age to work is strictly adhered to.

Whistle Blower Policy
If E-ppl Group personnel identify any potential signs of slavery, human trafficking or other human
rights abuses they are encouraged to report all instances to management as we will not tolerate
harassment, victimization or discrimination in any form and operate access to remedy for all victims.
To date we have received no reports of concerns regarding slavery or human trafficking in our
operations. In the event that such issues were reported to us, we would undertake an immediate
and thorough investigation into the concerns raised under the supervision of members of the E-ppl
Board of Management. If the investigation confirmed the concerns, we would put in place robust
action plans to address the issue and protect the victims.

AIP Policy
As a group of companies we recognise the benefits of staff health and wellbeing whilst at the same
time having a robust, clearly understood procedure for managing sickness absence that ensures staff
are treated fairly and compassionately when they are absent due to illness and helps staff to return
when they are fit to do so. This gives employees the opportunity to speak openly about any
underlying reasons that are contributing to their wellbeing in a confidential environment enabling
any help and support to be identified and provided.

Training
E-ppl Managers and Team Leaders are trained to monitor record and report where workers
appearance may show signs of injury or malnourishment. They talk informally to workers to discuss
if they are experiencing any issues.

We believe that training and education are fundamental tools in the fight against modern slavery
and we deliver specific training to ensure our staff are able to spot the signs of modern slavery and
help to provide a safe environment for our staff.

As a business we monitor which bank accounts our employees request their salaries / wages are paid
into and that there is no duplication of accounts or that workers pay is not paid into someone else’s
account. Pay slips can be made available to individuals by post, email, or secure online portals.

Continually Evolving Our Approach to Combatting Modern Day Slavery
Our policies and ethos are clear on the need to protect human rights in a transparent nondiscriminatory manner driven from Board level down. However, we recognize that these measures
only allow for a limited degree of comfort that slavery is not occurring within our business and that
of our supply chain. We continue to develop policies and take action to determine how we can
further combat this growing modern-day problem.

As part of future development, we plan to generate and issue a supplier questionnaire that is
completed annually alongside physical on-site audits to over and above 75% of our supplier partners
as an initial starting point. From the results of these two activities and the resulting analysis of that
data and appropriate actions taken we can further mitigate the risk to individuals within our supply
chain.

McDonald’s UK Standards of Business Conduct
At McDonald’s, we take seriously our responsibility to respect and promote human rights and to act with due
diligence to avoid infringing on the human rights of others and addressing any impacts on human rights if they
occur. We are committed to respecting human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our
Human Rights Policy (“Policy”) is also guided by the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights, the International Bill of Human Rights, and the principles set out in the International Labour Organization’s
Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.
We strive to foster safe, inclusive, and respectful workplaces wherever we do business and respect the
fundamental rights of McDonald’s employees, which are: freedom from slavery and child labour; freedom to
associate (or not associate) and collectively bargain; equal opportunity for everyone; a safe and healthy workplace;
and freedom from discrimination and harassment. Where McDonald’s may impact the human rights of particularly
vulnerable groups, such as migrant labourers, indigenous peoples, women, or children, we are also guided by other
international standards that elaborate on their rights.
Introduction

New Areas of Focus, 2019
· McDonald’s Corporation launched training for Human Rights Policy for all staff.
· Held in-person training on human rights for McDonald’s Corporation senior leadership.
· McDonald’s Corporation partnered with AIM-Progress to deliver optional training on forced and child labour,
wages and working hours, and health and safety for suppliers in Brazil
· Expanded stakeholder engagement and solicited key stakeholder feedback on supply chain human rights.
This statement is published in accordance with the UK Modern Slavery Act. It outlines the approach and steps we
take to prevent modern slavery in our business and supply chains associated with the registered operation in the
United Kingdom. Due to the impact of Coronavirus and pressure on resources, the publication of this statement
was delayed by a few days in line with the six month extension granted by the UK Government.
McDonald’s Restaurants Limited (“McDonald’s UK” or “Company” or “we”) published its first Modern Slavery
statement in July 2017. We continue to build our knowledge and understanding of the risks of modern slavery and
the areas of our business that could face some of these challenges. We work across our business and supply chain
to put the right practices in place to prevent and respond to any potential risks. Modern slavery is unacceptable
within our business and supply chains. We have a responsibility to respect the rights of people who work for the
Company, and to do business with franchisees, suppliers and business partners that respect human rights for their
own people too. We recognise there is no single solution to human rights issues, which is why it is critical that we
engage with all of these stakeholders to build awareness and understanding.

Our Business
UK
We are proud to have run our business in the UK for over 45 years, having opened our first restaurant in Woolwich
in 1974. We are a franchised business and today, we and our franchisees operate over 1,300 restaurants in all
corners of the UK and employ over 125,000 people. Alongside the restaurants, we have a head office function
based across five offices in regions across the country, with our main UK office in East Finchley, London.
Approximately 10% of McDonald’s restaurants in the UK are owned and operated by the Company with around
90% owned and operated by franchisees. From the £1.1 billion we and our franchisees have directly invested in our
restaurants since 2014, to the partnerships we collectively hold with national and local groups to support the
causes that matter most to local communities, we are passionate about contributing to the areas in which we
operate.
Global
McDonald’s Corporation is the world’s leading global foodservice retailer, serving 69 million people every day.
McDonald’s harnesses the power of our franchisees, suppliers and employees working together toward our
common goal of serving delicious, feel-good moments for everyone. Franchisees bring the spirit of
entrepreneurship and commitment to communities; suppliers are dedicated to highest levels of quality and safety;
and McDonald’s Corporation facilitates learning and sharing across more than 38,000 McDonald’s restaurants.
McDonald’s Corp. and McDonald’s UK (together, “McDonald’s”) work across all three elements of our business—the
Company, the franchisees, and our supplier partners—to use our scale for good for our communities, the
environment and our people. Our approach to modern slavery and ensuring human rights is underpinned by this
same commitment.
Our supply chains
McDonald’s has a complex global supply chain and works with supply chain partners, which employ millions of
workers in over 105 countries.
Suppliers are a critical component of McDonald’s business. We build long-term relationships with our supplier
partners, and are proud that many of them have worked with us for decades. These long-term relationships enable
us to have open and honest conversations and to share best practices.
We know that a large part of the success of the McDonald’s system lies in our trusted relationships with our
supplier partners. We expect all suppliers, regardless of the cultural, social and economic context, to meet our
expectations of fundamental rights for all people. This means treating their own people with fairness, respect and

dignity, and following practices that protect the health and safety and employment rights for the people working in
their facilities.
By working with our supplier partners, we continue to focus on our priority of serving safe, quality, and sustainably
sourced food that our customers can trust.
Specifically in the UK, we are proud to support the UK farming community, who supply us with quality ingredients
and we seek to source locally wherever possible.
All of the ingredients on our menu are sourced from approved supplier partners who have to adhere to our high
quality standards, which are independently audited. Where possible, our supplier partners source ingredients from
farms accredited by a recognised farm assurance scheme such as Red Tractor and RSPCA Assured, with regular
audits taking place on the farms to ensure that these standards are upheld. In addition, many of our supply chains
are vertically integrated, meaning that our supplier partners will often have control and oversight of every step of
the supply chain.
In 2012, McDonald’s UK established Farm Forward, our long-term sustainability programme to support British and
Irish farming. Through Farm Forward we aim to help farmers run thriving businesses by investing in programmes
and research to develop skills and knowledge, raise standards of animal welfare and make environmental
improvements.
Every year as part of our Progressive Young Farmers Programme up to nine university students spend 12 months
getting to know every part of our supply chain, usually during their placement year. They follow our products from
the farms who supply us, through to our restaurants and get the opportunity to work with a number of different
suppliers, farmers and stakeholders around the country. As part of their induction, they receive comprehensive
training to prepare them to operate safely in and understand the risks associated with the workplace.
Additionally, the McDonald’s Flagship Farmers programme was launched to develop and celebrate a network of
farms that demonstrate excellence in the three sustainability areas that underpin a healthy and progressive farm
business: economic viability, ethical practices and environmental safeguarding. Under ethical practices,
McDonald’s global priority impact areas include human rights.
Through our approach to continuous improvement, we continue to work with our food and farming partners to
understand changes in the industry and make sure that our initiatives make a real difference to not only the
farmers that supply our menu, but the wider industry too.
Our people
At McDonald’s UK, we are committed to promoting a safe, inclusive, and respectful workplace for all of our people.
From our kitchens and dining areas to our head offices, our success would not be possible without the great work
of our people, which is why it is so important we respect and invest in them. We believe in developing a culture in
which our people are treated with dignity and respect at all times.
Our Gender Pay Report, published in April 2019, showed that our median (middle in a set of figures) pay gap was 0
per cent and our mean (average of a set of figures) pay gap was 4 per cent. This is significantly below the mean
national average of 17.1 per cent. These figures are even lower in our restaurants, where both the median pay gap
and the mean pay gap is 0 per cent. We are proud of the results, and will continue to push ourselves to ensure that
we remain committed to providing a diverse and fair place to work. Our 2020 Gender Pay report will be published in
due course.
We know that a motivated and engaged team of people in our restaurants is vital when building a great place to
work. That is why we are committed to creating an environment of open and honest communication, where
everyone has access to the support they may need and the tools they need to have their voices heard.
Another component of a great workplace culture is the ability to speak freely and openly about any concerns or
worries, including those relating to ethics and human rights. This includes an anonymous channel, the Business
Integrity Line, staffed by a live operator from an independent company 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Our
People Services Helpdesk is also available every day of the year for our people to raise any concerns that they may
have in relation to any aspect of their working lives.
Feedback from our people is an important way of understanding how they feel about coming to work. We ask for

this feedback anonymously throughout the year through our Love to listen survey. This is conducted four times a
year to better understand the views and concerns of our people. Each restaurant and head office department
receives the feedback from this survey and then develops an action plan which supports continuous improvement
to the working environment.
In addition, our global head office functions are asked for feedback anonymously twice a year through a Global
pulse survey in addition to specific department global surveys.
We aim to support our people in speaking freely about their experiences and concerns about their working
environment. Through our Love to Listen Meet up Sessions, How’s It Going chats and our “always on” approach to
listening, our people can speak individually or in groups about any issues they may face in the workplace. In the
example of the Love to Listen Meet up, these feedback sessions follow a process which ensure that any concerns
are rectified via an action plan drawn up after the sessions.
Our People Relations team have also introduced “creating a respectful workplace” learning materials which were
introduced across the business to support our people first culture. This is a great example of continually looking to
build and improve on the listening platforms already in place to encourage our people to speak freely about their
experiences.
Policies
McDonald’s UK supports the goals of the UK Modern Slavery Act and we take seriously our responsibility to act
with due diligence to avoid infringing on the human rights of others and address any impact on human rights if
they occur.
Employment practices
We conduct our activities in a manner that respects human rights as set out in the United Nations Declaration of
Human Rights, and we are committed to ethical recruitment in our employment practices as a component of our
overall human rights approach. We prohibit direct or indirect fees or costs being charged to those seeking
employment with or who are employed by the Company for the services directly related to recruitment for
temporary or permanent job placement, unless legally permissible and within the legal limit. This includes where
we may use private recruitment services or where we perform recruitment activities directly. Even where such
fees or costs are legally permissible and within the legal limit, our policies and practices are designed to ensure
that no one is indebted to the Company or to a recruiter in a manner that prohibits the individual from freely
leaving their employment.
When checking someone’s legal right to work for the Company in line with UK Right to Work procedures set down
by the Government, we operate document retention practices which ensure that workers maintain control of their
identity documents. Some of our UK right to work checks in restaurants are carried out by a third party company,
which also adheres to the same standards and is also subject to our Supplier Code of Conduct.
McDonald’s UK provides any agreements, whether oral or in writing, in a language understood by the person
agreeing to be employed or to work in any capacity for McDonald’s UK, and expects that any recruiter, labour
broker or employment agent will do the same and will be responsible for ensuring that the agreement is
understood by the person agreeing to be employed. If there are any changes to any agreements, such as due to a
change in UK legislation or working practices, these are communicated without unreasonable delay to the
individual. Further, in 2019, we revised the employment handbook for our hourly paid employees to be fully digital
and modern in its language and tone of voice to make it even more accessible for our people.
Human Rights
In 2018, McDonald’s published a global Human Rights Policy, which reinforces McDonald’s commitment to respect
and promote human rights. The Policy was developed with input from expert third parties and is guided by the UN
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the International Bill of Human Rights, and the principles set out
in the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Where
McDonald’s may impact the human rights of particularly vulnerable groups, we are also guided by other
international standards that elaborate on their rights. This Policy applies to McDonald’s Corporation and its
majority-owned subsidiaries around the world, including McDonald’s UK.
A commitment to respect human rights is also set out in McDonald’s Standards of Business Conduct, which apply

to all employees of the Company. We strive to foster a safe, inclusive, and respectful workplaces wherever we do
business and respect the fundamental rights of McDonald’s employees. McDonald’s staff in the UK are trained
annually on the Standards of Business Conduct and are required to certify their understanding of and commitment
to upholding the Standards.
Employees may raise human rights issues, or report potential or actual human rights issues through a number of
reporting channels, including contacting Human Resources or the Global Compliance Office. Reports received by
the Global Compliance Office of alleged violations of the Standards of Business Conduct or other McDonald’s
policies by McDonald’s employees are always reviewed and addressed as appropriate. Equally, employees can
raise concerns on any alleged wrongdoing or illegality via the McDonald’s Whistleblowing Policy. Concerns can be
raised anonymously and in confidence and all such concerns are investigated as appropriate.
We continue to work with external stakeholders to actively review our approach and global policies related to
protecting human rights, to give greater transparency and clarity on our commitments and ensure they remain
aligned with internationally recognised standards.
Assessing and Mitigating Risk in our Supply Chain
Supplier Code of Conduct & Supply Workplace Accountability Program
The Supplier Code of Conduct applies to McDonald's suppliers globally. It sets out our expectations for suppliers on
critical topics including human rights, workplace environment, business integrity and environmental management.
We expect supplier self-managed excellence in these four areas through the implementation of their own
management systems. McDonald’s provides a Supplier Guidance Document to assist suppliers in meeting the
standards. McDonald’s launched the first Supplier Code of Conduct in 1993 and has evolved and strengthened it
over time to reflect updated international human rights standards, consultations with external experts, a human
rights gap analysis, and dialogue with suppliers.
McDonald’s expects all suppliers and their facilities to meet the standards and promote the principles outlined in
the Code. We also expect our suppliers to hold their own supply chain, including subcontractors and third-party
labour agencies, to the same standards contained in the Supplier Code of Conduct. Fundamental to the Code is
the expectation of ethical employment practices by suppliers and their supply chain, including subcontractors and
third-party labour agencies. The Code prohibits any form of slave, forced, bonded, indentured, or involuntary
prison labour. Suppliers and third-party labour agencies are prohibited from retaining employees’ governmentissued identification, passports or work permits as a condition of employment.
The Supplier Code of Conduct is the cornerstone of the global Supplier Workplace Accountability (SWA) program,
which aims to help suppliers understand McDonald’s expectations, verify compliance with our expectations and
work toward continuous improvement. At the end of 2019, we had over 4,000 facilities participating in the SWA
program across 98 countries, with 91 supplying McDonald’s UK. The program audits many different types of
facilities and products, such as food, packaging, uniforms and Happy Meal Toys.
The SWA program is built on a model of continuous improvement and education. It includes guidance to suppliers
on complying with our standards, including our expectation that our suppliers hold their own supply chains to the
same high standards. We provide suppliers with training to understand the SWA requirements and how to comply
with our standards. Suppliers can also choose to undergo online training to understand the expectations of SWA.
Suppliers are required to complete a rigorous self-assessment questionnaire that appraises the supplier’s current
practices and management systems. After completing the self-assessment questionnaire, suppliers receive a
report indicating areas of opportunity.
The SWA program also includes on-site announced and unannounced audits conducted by third-party auditing
firms to assess compliance with the Code. McDonald’s works with third-party auditing firms that have expert
knowledge, local insight and an understanding of local languages and cultures. On-site audits are physical
inspections of the facility and include visits to housing and cafeterias for workers. Auditors also conduct private
worker interviews and review facility records and business practices to assess compliance with the Code.
Modern slavery risks are addressed specifically as part of the audit, including a review of ethical recruitment
practices to verify that workers are employed under voluntary conditions and have freedom of movement. This
includes verification that workers are not charged illegal fees as a condition of employment; worker contracts are
in local language and signed by the worker; and that suppliers do not retain workers’ government-issued

identification, passports or work permits.
Understanding and managing risk
An important element of the global human rights due diligence approach is understanding global and national
human rights risks and using this information to support the Supplier Workplace Accountability programme. In
addition to the audits described above, McDonald’s assesses the potential human rights risks of our supply chains,
including modern slavery risks, using desk-based research, supply chain mapping, and stakeholder engagement.
One key indicator of risk is the country of origin from which products or raw materials are sourced for the
McDonald’s system. Country-level human rights risk analyses are used to help inform the audit cycles for suppliers.
Facilities situated in countries that are considered to be at high risk require more regular on-site audits, regardless
of the outcome of previous audits.
McDonald’s works hard to continuously improve how we source our ingredients in a way that allows people,
animals and the planet to thrive. We want to ensure that our sustainable sourcing programs drive lasting,
meaningful outcomes on critical issues for people, animals, the environment and our business. McDonald’s defines
sustainable sourcing through what we call the three “E”s—ethical practices, environmental protection and longterm economic viability— and we’ve identified seven priority impact areas to support them. Although our longterm goal is to source all of our food and packaging sustainability, we have focused on six priority products that
were identified through independent analysis by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) as the products that carry the
greatest sustainability impacts and where we have the most potential to create positive change. Part of our
sustainable sourcing for these six priority products requires our suppliers to purchase sustainably certified
products where such certifications exist, several of which audit for social compliance at farm-level.
Effective action
Since the SWA Program began, McDonald’s has provided optional training, and engaged with thousands of
suppliers and facilities. Over time, suppliers have taken on increased ownership over compliance processes—
there are nine supplier-led compliance and reporting programs—and we have been pleased to see an
improvement in compliance overall.
Where a noncompliance is identified through an on-site audit, suppliers work with a third-party audit firm to
complete a corrective and preventative action plan to address the noncompliance. The plan must provide specific
time frames within which corrective action will be taken, root causes analysed, and policies and procedures
updated. In addition, the plan must be designed to avoid recurrence of the noncompliance and establish specific
accountability. In instances of significant non-compliance, suppliers are subject to a follow-up audit to ensure that
the non-compliances have been properly addressed.
The SWA programme is designed to support suppliers in meeting our standards. However, there are
circumstances under which McDonald's will remove a supplier from the supply chain to address instances of
significant noncompliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct.
In addition to training, auditing, and other aspects of the SWA program, McDonald’s requires that suppliers provide
their own internal reporting mechanisms to ensure their people have a confidential, safe, and timely way to report
workplace concerns without the fear of retaliation. The Code stipulates that suppliers create internal grievance
mechanisms and programmes for handling reports of workplace grievances, including anonymous reports. The
Supplier Guidance Document provides a step-by-step best practice process to help suppliers establish an
effective grievance mechanism, guided by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
In addition, McDonald's Business Integrity Line and an email address are open to third parties, including suppliers
and their people, to raise concerns with breaches of the Supplier Code of Conduct.
Training on modern slavery and human rights
To help employees understand human rights a mandatory training for staff on the Human Rights Policy was
released in 2019. Available in 15 languages, the training has a section on forced labour that identifies particularly
vulnerable groups and outlines McDonald’s commitments surrounding ethical recruitment. McDonald’s UK staff
employees are also trained regularly on the Standards of Business Conduct and are required to annually certify
their understanding of and commitment to upholding the Standards. In 2019, McDonald’s Corporation’s senior
leadership also received in-person training in partnership with an external human rights consultancy.

Given their important role in working with suppliers, McDonald’s supply chain procurement employees undergo inperson and webinar trainings on supporting suppliers in meeting their expectations under the Supplier Code of
Conduct and SWA program. In 2020, McDonald’s is developing a new online training module for procurement
employees to enhance their understanding of human rights issues in global supply chains.
For suppliers, the global SWA programme includes an online training platform where they can access materials
that provide guidance on preventing modern slavery. Training modules include: Ensuring Eligibility to Work,
Protecting the Rights of Migrant Labour, and Implementing Grievance Mechanisms. For example, the Migrant
Labour training aims to educate suppliers on the risks related to modern slavery when sourcing migrant labour and
some key actions they can take to ensure they are protecting the rights of migrant workers in their facilities.
Partnering to improve standards and identify emerging issues
McDonald’s UK is committed to engaging with stakeholders to continue to advance our approach to human rights.
McDonald’s UK engages with stakeholders in our system in a variety of ways. For example, within the Company,
McDonald’s employees provide feedback via multiple reporting mechanisms, including via people managers,
human resources and through participation in surveys. Within our supply chain chains, external monitoring firms
conduct on-site audits of supplier facilities through the SWA program include on-site interviews.
McDonald’s Corp. seeks feedback from human rights experts and advocates. In 2019, McDonald’s convened a
multi-stakeholder roundtable of human rights experts and advocates on the sidelines of the UN Forum on Business
and Human Rights. The group included stakeholders from civil society, academia, the public sector, peer
companies and international organisations. The group received an update on McDonald’s supply chain human
rights activities and provided feedback and advice on how to advance the program.
We believe that real, systemic change throughout the supply chain requires partnership with industry. That’s why
McDonald’s joined the ICTI Care Program for Happy Meals toys in 2016, bringing together industry partners to
support a sustainable supply chain for the toy and entertainment industry. To ensure our supplier program
addresses emerging human rights issues and risks, we also participate in initiatives such as AIM-PROGRESS, a
business initiative focused on responsible sourcing, and Business for Social Responsibility’s Human Rights
Working Group (HRWG), which supports implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights in a shared-learning forum of more than 40 companies.
Looking forward
We know that there is no single solution to the challenges of modern slavery and human trafficking, and we must
therefore continue to learn and understand the associated risks and warning signs. By working across all elements
of our business and supply chain, we can continue to build our knowledge of these issues and take steps to
improve our collective awareness. We will engage these different elements of our organisation, as well as expert
third parties, to identify areas for improvement.
Statement approval

human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 December 2019. The Board of McDonald’s

Hamburg Süd
Modern Slavery Statement
This statement is made in accordance with Section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 by Hamburg Südamerikanische
Dampfschifffahrts-Gesellschaft A/S & Co KG (hereinafter Hamburg Süd), reporting as part of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S.
It provides an overview of Maersk’s policies and processes relating to the management of the risk of modern slavery, and
should be regarded as complementary to the A.P. Moller - Maersk Sustainability Report. For further information on our
activities and progress, please see the Sustainability Report 2018.
A.P. Moller - Maersk is a global integrator of container logistics, aiming to connect and simplify our customers’ supply
chains. Maersk employs about 80.000 people across operations in around 130 countries.

Policies and Governance
A.P. Moller - Maersk strives to conduct business in a responsible and upright manner, in line with the A.P. Moller - Maersk
Values, and is committed to good and fair labour conditions in our own operations and supply chain. We refrain from
practices that can give rise to risks of forced or involuntary labour, human trafficking and other practices defined as
‘modern slavery’.

Hamburg Süd Principles of Social and Ecological Responsibility
Hamburg Süd is guided by its Principles of Social and Ecological Responsibility, which are overseen by its management board and which state the commitments related to human rights and forced labour:
“The Company respects and supports the observance of internationally recognised human rights and does not
tolerate any conduct disregarding such rights.”
“The Company does not accept any form of forced labour.”

Principles for Global Employee Relations
As part of A.P. Moller - Maersk, all Hamburg Süd employees are covered by a single set of Principles for Global
Employee Relations, designed to protect their rights and safety. The Principles for Global Employee Relations framework are implemented across A.P. Moller - Maersk with the aim of furthering constructive and productive relations
with employees and their representatives, ensuring that employee relations and working conditions serve the interests of both the employees and the company.
“Maersk will not use any form of forced or involuntary labour, and refrains from practices that can give rise to a risk
of involuntary labour” - Maersk Principles for Global Employee Relations
Responsibility for monitoring the implementation of and compliance with the Principles for Global Employee Relations rests with the A.P. Moller - Maersk Global Employee Relations Council, reporting to the Chief Human Resources Officer of A.P. Moller - Maersk.

Third Party Code of Conduct
The A.P. Moller - Maersk Third Party Code of Conduct describes expected business conduct by suppliers, third-party agents and contractors (hereafter ‘suppliers’) to A.P. Moller - Maersk. The code is implemented through a global
Responsible Procurement Programme (please see further below). The code sets out expectations concerning responsible business behaviour in the areas of health and safety, equal opportunity rights, compensation and working
hours, child labour and forced or involuntary labour, freedom of association, anti-corruption and environment.
“We expect our suppliers to not use or benefit from, forced or involuntary labour as per ‘Guidelines & Good Business
Practice’ addition to the Code. All employees shall enjoy the freedom of movement during the course of their employment. Personal/employment documents or payment of compensation must not be withheld, thereby preventing
such an employee from terminating his/her employment.
We provide specific guidance to our suppliers on how to identify and prevent forced labour in their own operations
and their supply chains” - Third Party Code of Conduct
The leaders of our businesses and the Head of Maersk Procurement are responsible for implementing the Responsible Procurement Programme, reporting to the Chief Operating Office of A.P. Moller - Maersk.
In addition, local procurement by Hamburg Süd entities is also subject to the Hamburg Süd Code of Conduct for
Suppliers.

A.P. Moller - Maersk Whistleblower System
We take seriously any allegations that human rights are not respected in our operations or business relationships.
Allegations can be reported by any person within or outside A.P. Moller - Maersk through our Whistle-blower system,
available worldwide in more than 75 languages. It enables people to report concerns safely on all human rights issues, including human trafficking and forced or involuntary labour, child labour, and actions harming persons, their
livelihood or properties, related to our operations, suppliers, contractors, third-party agents, and other business partners with a direct link to A.P. Moller - Maersk. During 2018, the system received no reports relating to modern slavery.

Due Diligence in our Supply Chain
Managing our supply chain risks is of special importance due to less direct oversight and control of working conditions
and recruiting practices. All suppliers with a contractual agreement are as a minimum required to follow our Third-Party
Code of Conduct or equivalent international standards.
A P. Moller - Maersk interacts with approximately 72,000 suppliers every year in more than 100 countries. Out of these, we
have a continuous engagement with approximately 24,000 suppliers. We monitor supplier adherence to our Third-Party
Code of Conduct through our global Responsible Procurement programme. Monitoring is prioritised according to a riskbased approach. This means we focus our follow-up efforts on those suppliers that we assess are at heightened risk of
having adverse impacts within the areas covered by the code. In 2018, the current approach was further sharpened with
a geographical risk mapping and by combining it with supplier risk categories to drive focused efforts. This is available on
our website here. We currently operate with 15 high-risk supplier categories, which are listed on our website. There are
approximately 3,000 suppliers in the first and second tier of these high-risk categories (see box).

Modern Slavery Statement

Supplier risk assessment
Within these high-risk categories we assess 1st tier suppliers and selected
2nd tier suppliers using a combination of onsite audits, self-assessments
and documentation reviews, where suppliers’ performance is compared to
the requirements of our Third-Party Code of Conduct. The assessments are
reviewed either by our Responsible Procurement team or by an approved
third-party auditor. Based on findings, improvement plans are agreed and
implemented.
For selected categories of suppliers, we undertake further due diligence measures:
n

n

Assets under construction includes suppliers building vessels and terminals, where employment conditions of subcontracted workers could
present a risk. These suppliers must be audited on-site prior to or shortly
after contract signing.
Indirect hiring and recruitment enables operational flexibility, but can
also pose a risk due to the less direct oversight of how workers, often recruited across multiple countries by e.g. manning and crewing agencies
or local contractors, are hired. When contracting third party manning and
crewing agencies for our shipping businesses, we follow standardised
auditing guidelines. This includes: periodic audits and self-assessment
questionnaires through our Responsible Procurement Programme, and
additional assessments to ensure their compliance with the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) standards before entering contracts.

Please visit our website for more information on how we address human rights and responsible procurement or have a
look at our 2018 Sustainability Report.

Findings and experiences
During 2018, we conducted 40 audits and 1029 self-assessments of suppliers in high-risk categories. We have established 177 Improvement Plans with suppliers where we identified critical and major gaps against our Third-Party Code
of Conduct. We encountered no instances of modern slavery practices but in a few cases, we asked suppliers to adopt
written policies on forced and bonded labour. In 2018, we were made aware of poor working conditions for workers employed by subcontractors in Kenya. We take such instances very seriously and have initiated an assessment to ascertain
the working conditions of impacted workers and take action to address any violations of our Third-Party Code of Conduct. The learnings will be used to strengthen our assessment approach for the third-party Terminals supplier category,
where we have initiated a pilot through our Responsible Procurement program to cover 10 third-party terminals in high
risk countries with further roll-out in 2019.
Focusing on our own company, in 2018 we conducted an internal labour rights self-assessment covering both direct staff
and third-party employees in all our entities world-wide. We found that in a few countries where we operate, local laws
and practices may require employees to obtain approval from their current employer if they wish to move to a different
employer. There are also a limited number of cases where employees are granted loans by the company. Based on the
assessment we will take further steps to ensure that such practices do not create a risk of involuntary labour.

Training
During 2018 we rolled-out a new e-Learning module on international labour standards covering the following topics:
equal treatment; freedom of association and collective bargaining; child labour; forced labour; working hours; compensation, health and safety; and grievance mechanisms. The 30-minute training is for all employees and has so far been
completed by two thirds of the A.P Moller - Maersk workforce. Alongside this we continued specialised training on international labour standards for those employees who deal with manning agencies, with a special focus on inland service
operations. In 2018, this included 8 training workshops for a total of 200 employees across the businesses, both as faceto-face sessions and as webinars focusing on practices and rights related to labour.

Modern slavery and human trafficking statement
Accessibility
If you need this policy in a different language, another format or any help
reading this document, then please get in touch with the HR department.
Introduction
This statement, made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery
Act 2015, sets out Ascenti’s actions to understand all potential modern
slavery risks related to its business and to put in place steps that are
aimed at ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafficking in its own
business and its supply chains. This statement relates to actions and
activities during the financial year 2018/2019.
As part of the healthcare sector, Ascenti recognises that it has a
responsibility to take a robust approach to slavery and human
trafficking. Ascenti is absolutely committed to preventing slavery and
human trafficking in its corporate activities, and ensuring that those in its
supply chains, and contractors, are free from slavery and human
trafficking and comply with our values.
Organisational structure and supply chains
This policy covers the activities of Ascenti Holdings Limited, Ascenti
Health Limited, Ascenti Physio Limited, and File Dynamics Limited.
Ascenti is a provider of rehabilitation services providing services to
insurers, employers, the NHS, personal injury and private patients,
nationwide. Ascenti includes the organisation File Dynamics Limited,

is in Fareham but operates from numerous sites across the UK; in
Close

England, Scotland and Wales.
Ascenti’s supply chain mainly comprises physiotherapy and treatment
providers instructed to provide physiotherapy and related services. Our
supply chain also comprises suppliers as expected in the running of
offices and physiotherapy and assessment clinics; including facilities
services, recruitment agencies, training and equipment providers.
The Ascenti Group currently only operates in the UK and collectively the
Ascenti Group has an annual turnover in excess of £36m.
Risk Assessment Process
On an annual basis, Ascenti evaluates the business risks, comprising
country risks, sector risks, transaction risks and business partnerships,
to determine whether or not particular activities or countries are high
risk in relation to slavery or human trafficking. Any risks identified from
the above process will be prioritised and dealt with in accordance with
the due diligence section below.
High-risk activities
Ascenti does not believe it has any particular activities or is involved with
any countries which are high risk in relation to slavery or human
trafficking.
Responsibility
Responsibility for Ascenti's anti-slavery initiatives is as follows:
Overall: Ascenti Executive Leadership Team
Policies: HR department.
Risk assessment, Due diligence and Training: Associate Director,
Governance & Quality
Relevant policies
Ascenti operates the following policies that describe its approach to the
identification of modern slavery risks and steps to be taken to prevent

slavery and human trafficking in its operations:
Whistleblowing policy: Ascenti encourages all its staff, clients and
other business partners to report any concerns related to the direct
activities, or the supply chains of, Ascenti. This includes any
circumstances that may give rise to an enhanced risk of slavery or
human trafficking. Ascenti's whistleblowing procedure is designed to
make it easy for staff to make disclosures, without fear of retaliation.
Employees, clients or others who have concerns can complete our
confidential disclosure form.
Employee code of conduct: Ascenti’s code makes clear to employees
the actions and behaviour expected of them when representing
Ascenti. Ascenti strives to maintain the highest standards of employee
conduct and ethical behaviour when operating abroad and managing
its supply chain.
Environmental Management System: It is part of Ascenti’s on-going
commitment to reduce the impact the company has on the
environment by checking and monitoring suppliers and contractors
standards through a third party questionnaire. This process of
checking supplier standards can be expanded to include Human
Trafficking and slavery checks to increase knowledge and confidence
when dealing with suppliers and contractors.
Quality Management System: The Quality Policy sets out Ascenti’s
commitment to high quality practices, including a collaborative
partnership approach to working with our key suppliers. Our
commitment to this approach allows us to have confidence in our
suppliers’ commitment to preventing slavery and human trafficking in
their operations, and those of their suppliers.
Sustainability and Environmental Management Policy: This policy
builds upon our ISO14001 Environmental Management System to
incorporate wider aspects of sustainability, beyond environmental
aspects, and details Ascenti’s approach to sustainability. Ascenti
recognises that sustainable practices are good for business, good for
our commissioners and purchasers, and good for the localities and
communities within which we operate. Sustainability must be an
integral part of our operations, ensuring that we consider the wider
impact of our business operations and decisions. This contributes to a

sustainable future recognising that we need to meet the needs of the
present without compromising the future.
Due diligence
Ascenti has committed to undertaking due diligence when considering
taking on new
suppliers, and regularly reviews its existing suppliers. Ascenti's due
diligence and reviews will include:
Broadly considering suppliers to assess particular product or
geographical risks of modern slavery and human trafficking;
When engaging a new frequent supplier as part of contract
negotiations/tender processes, enquire if they are a business that is
required to have a Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement,
and what policies they have in place;
Evaluating the modern slavery and human trafficking risks of each new
supplier;
Where we identify high risk areas, explore those suppliers in greater
detail;
Taking steps to improve substandard suppliers' practices, including
providing advice to suppliers and requiring them to implement action
plans;
Where a potential frequent supplier is unwilling to provide statements,
or complete a questionnaire on the matter, we will consider if we
commence that business relationship;
Invoking sanctions against suppliers that fail to improve their
performance in line with an action plan, including the termination of
the business relationship.
Ensuring contractual controls are in place with suppliers in relation to
complying with Modern Slavery legislation.
Performance indicators

In order to assess the effectiveness of our approach to modern slavery
Ascenti will be reviewing on an annual basis the following areas:
Staff awareness
Reviewing existing supply chains; and
Developing a new suppliers’ evaluation process.
Awareness-raising programme
Ascenti will raise awareness of modern slavery issues via our intranet,
explaining:
The basic principles of the Modern Slavery Act 2015;
How employers can identify and prevent slavery and human
trafficking;
What employees can do to flag up potential slavery or human
trafficking issues to the relevant parties within the Company; and
What external help is available.

The Modern Slavery Act 2015 requires commercial organisations supplying goods or services with a
turnover of above £36 million to prepare and publish an annual 'Slavery and Human Trafﬁcking
Statement'. The Statement must set out the steps an organisation has taken, if any, during its ﬁnancial year
to ensure that slavery or human trafﬁcking is not taking place in its supply chain.

THE MODERN SLAVERY ACT 2015

What is Modern Slavery?
Modern slavery is an international crime, affecting an estimated 29.8 million slaves around the world. It is a
growing global issue that transcends age, gender and ethnicities. It includes victims who have been brought from
overseas and vulnerable people in the UK, who are forced to illegally work against their will across many different
sectors such as agriculture, hospitality, construction, retail and manufacturing.
Our policy
Cepac is working towards establishing a zero-tolerance position on violations of anti-human trafﬁcking and antimodern slavery laws. If we ﬁnd breaches of these laws within our supply chain, we will look to support companies
in their efforts to comply with the legislation. We will also actively consider how we support or conduct business
with organisations involved in slavery, human trafﬁcking, forced or child labour.
Our values, which include: excellence; respect, and responsibility, underpin our culture and how we do business.
They are embedded throughout our business and set the parameters for how we expect people to behave with their
colleagues, clients and the world at large. We seek to treat everyone fairly and consistently, creating a workplace
and business environment that is open, transparent and trusted. Our policies and procedures relating to the Modern
Slavery Act are in line with our culture and values.
Our procedures
We have a number of procedures in place that contribute to ensuring modern slavery does not occur in our business
or supply chains.
Due Diligence and Risk Management in our Employment processes:
Robust recruitment processes in line with UK employment laws, including: 'right to work' document checks;
contracts of employment and checks to ensure everyone employed is 16 and above.
Market-related pay and reward, which is reviewed annually and linked to professional services ﬁrms'
benchmarks.
An enhanced beneﬁts package, providing additional health and welfare options to support our people's (and their
families) lifestyle choices.
Due Diligence and Risk Management in our supply chains:
We recognise our company is exposed to greater risk when dealing with its suppliers, particularly those who have
operations/suppliers in other territories. The following measures to review and manage this risk are in place:

examination of our supply chains. We rigorously assess existing and potential suppliers and form a commitment
to collaborate closely with suppliers to help them understand and work towards their own obligations under the
Modern Slavery Act.
a Responsible Purchasing Policy, which reﬂects our commitment to and focus on suppliers' ethical supply
chain(s).
a Supplier Code of Conduct, which is used for all new major suppliers of goods or in re-tendering, clearly
stating the company's intention to step away (without penalty) if any occurrences of modern slavery are
discovered.
Both the Responsible Purchasing Policy and Supplier Code of Conduct will be reviewed annually, and updated as
and when deemed appropriate by the Cepac Directors, to ensure they are continually developed and remain ﬁt for
purpose. The monitoring of suppliers has increased signiﬁcantly in 2018, to include monitoring in accordance with
the Criminal Finances Act.
Employee training:
We want to help our people to understand more about this growing issue and how to report any suspicions they may
have, whether in a business or personal context. We have highlighted the modernslavery.co.uk site to all our
employees, which holds useful information on how to recognise different types of slavery, how to spot the signs
and provides details of a telephone helpline.
We have developed resources and made them available to our people, including summary documents with an
overview of the Modern Slavery Act, and links to the modernslavery.co.uk site.
Reporting knowledge or suspicion of slavery:
We already have in place a whistleblowing policy which ensures that anyone who has concerns, for example,
about how staff are behaving, has a means of raising their concerns conﬁdentially. The policy supports
employees in reporting any suspicions our employees may have regarding modern slavery and our employees
have been signposted to this in our communications.
Looking forward: key performance indicators
Going forward, we aim to work towards:
developing an employee training module that will be undertaken by all Cepac employees. This training will
outline what modern slavery is, how to identify it and what individuals should do if they suspect there are any
cases of slavery occurring. Completion of this training will form a compulsory part of our employees’ annual
review and new starter induction processes.
developing a procedure to monitor how our suppliers comply with our supplier Code of Conduct.
2018 Summary
During 2018, there were no concerns relating to slavery either discovered through our processes nor reported by
employees or third parties.
Cepac shall continue to take responsibility for this statement and its objectives, which will be reviewed and updated
as appropriate and for each ﬁnancial year.
This statement covers the Cepac ﬁnancial year of 2018 (January to December) and was approved by the board of
Directors on the 21st May 2019.

REVISED MARCH 2017

Gi GROUP UK POLICY

PREVENTION OF MODERN SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING POLICY

PREVENTION
Taking the key areas of risk into account, we aim to prevent
opportunities for occurrences of modern slavery by focusing on 3
business activities:
1. Development of policy/codes of practice
2. Raising awareness
3. Effective process implementation/consistent auditing

POLICY/CODES OF PRACTICE
Our key policies and codes of practice which relate to the prevention
of modern slavery are:
n Gi Global Code of Ethics
n Ethical Trading
n Preventing Hidden Labour Exploitation
n Stronger Together Initiative Code of Conduct
n Whistleblowing
n Anti-bribery
n Supplier Code of Conduct
n Second Tier Supplier

RAISING AWARENESS
Permanent Employees
All of our operational permanent employees are made aware of our
policies and internal process relating to the prevention of modern
slavery as part of the core operations training programme.
Classroom and on the job training is supported by specific online
modules and substantial guidance and reference material which can
be located on the company intranet.
Our commitment as a Stronger Together Business Partner along with
our active participation as members of the Association of Labour
Providers, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation and the
GLA Labour Provision Group open up essential communication
channels which enable us to provide a consistent flow of up to date
information and support tools.
Strong central control supports the operational network and
therefore the Head Office team are clear about the standard checks
and subsequent reports that they need to make and produce which
may in turn lead to the identification of potential issues.
Temporary Workforce
Initial awareness is raised by playing the Stronger Together video as
part of the recruitment process. Additional Stronger Together
resources, including advisory posters and leaflets, are placed in
prominent positions within all of our locations.
A temporary worker’s welfare also forms an essential part of the
initial interview process and then the ongoing relationship that we
have with them. Workers will be encouraged to report any concerns
that they have at any time during their relationship with us, including
confidential issues.
We also provide formal communication channels via worker
interviews during the internal audit process, central satisfaction
surveys and our modern slavery helpline.
We have recently introduced new time and attendance systems which
safeguard against worker substitution. New processes have also been
implemented in relation to duplicate bank accounts and home addresses
to support the existing monitoring carried out by the payroll team.
Suppliers
We have placed suppliers into two categories:
n Category 1: those who supply general goods and services
to Head Office and the operational network
n Category 2: second tier suppliers who supply temporary
workers to our operational locations
REVISED MARCH 2017

Category 1: operating predominantly as a service provider, the
range of goods and services that we purchase is relatively limited
however this does not mean that we underestimate the opportunities
for occurrences of modern slavery from within our supply chain. We
have identified our top 30 suppliers to be our main area of focus.
The top 30 are issued with our Supplier Code of Conduct and
requested to complete our supplier survey on an annual basis. Once
complete, our supplier risk profile is updated with any specific issues
being raised on a supplier by supplier basis.
Category 2: we consider second tier suppliers of temporary staff to
be a higher risk as they will face the same key issues as we do
ourselves. Prior to being approved, all potential suppliers will be
issued with the Supplier Code of Conduct, complete the standard
supplier questionnaire and sign a second tier agreement document.
Where required they will undergo an audit of their internal process
prior to supplying temporary staff. Depending on the frequency of
the supply, second tier agencies will also be subject to audits from
our internal team.

EFFECTIVE PROCESS IMPLEMENTATION AND
CONSISTENT AUDITING
Establishing policy and procedures and raising awareness by
delivering training and establishing effective communication
channels creates the framework for the prevention of modern slavery
and is a natural starting point.
Consistently checking that the theory is being implemented
practically on a daily basis establishes the current effectiveness of the
framework and will also identify improvements which can be made.
All operational locations have the initial responsibility for ensuring
that all of the key processes are implemented and that the relevant
checks are taking place. Our central audit team carries out the
following audits during the course of a trading year:
n Pre-arranged operational location audits (including
temporary worker interviews)
n Spot check operational location audits
n Spot check remote operational audits
n Spot check remote audits of effective use of relevant IT
equipment
n Pre-arranged Head Office-specific right to work in the UK audits
n Temporary worker complaint audits
n Second tier/supplier audits
Our temporary worker management systems enable us to take
regular snapshots of the diversity of the nationalities that we currently
have working at all operational locations. This enables us to identify
any unusual patterns or concerns relating to nationalities which may
pose the highest risk.
Results of the above are collated and reviewed by the Executive
Management Team and subsequently are made available to all
internal employees. The Group Compliance Manager / Head of
CSR has the direct responsibility for reviewing/evaluating any central
reports with a view to identifying, communicating and addressing
any potential areas of concern both internally and with the relevant
external authority when it is necessary to do so.

REVIEW
Following its initial introduction, this Prevention of Modern Slavery
and Human Trafficking Policy will be reviewed by the Executive
Management Team at least annually and may be reviewed from
time to time.

Anti Slavery Statement

Modern Slavery Act
Transparency Statement for
the Autovista Group
We have a zero tolerance approach to modern slavery and are fully
committed to preventing slavery and human traﬃcking in our corporate
activities. This statement sets out the steps we have taken to prevent slavery
and human traﬃcking from occurring within our organisation and our supply
chains. We constantly seek to improve our practices to combat slavery and
human traﬃcking.

Our Business
The Autovista Group (the “Group”) is a leading provider of automotive pricing
insights along the entire lifecycle of a vehicle. The Group provides pricing

insights across more than 30 markets. The Group has more than 700
employees and operates across Europe and Australia. This statement is made
on behalf of the new UK parent company of the Group, Autovista Bidco
Limited, following its acquisition of the Group in February 2019.

Our Supply Chains
Our supply chain includes suppliers from a number of sectors, particularly the
motor industry, IT software and hardware, and professional services. We also
use agencies to supply agency staﬀ.
Wherever possible, we seek to include appropriate provisions requiring
compliance with legislation, including the Modern Slavery Act 2015, in supplier
contracts.
To date, we are not aware of any slavery or human traﬃcking activities in our
supply chain. If any issue is highlighted to us in the future, then we would
undertake an urgent and thorough investigation. If the investigation
conﬁrmed the concerns, we would work with our supplier to ensure that
appropriate action was taken to address the issue. This action may include
the termination of our business relationship with that supplier.
The Group's People & Performance and Risk & Compliance teams would be
responsible, in the ﬁrst instance, for dealing with any risks or concerns raised
in relation to modern slavery.

Our Policies on Slavery and Human Traﬃcking
We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human
traﬃcking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. Our anti-slavery
and human traﬃcking policy reﬂects our commitment to acting ethically and
with integrity in all our business relationships. Compliance with the legislation,
including the Modern Slavery Act 2015, reﬂects our company values of
respect, openness, trust and integrity.
We ensure that all staﬀ working for us are engaged in accordance with the
law and undertake right to work checks on all direct employees prior to them
commencing their employment. This includes checking, where applicable,
that the employee has a valid work visa and is of an appropriate age to work.
In addition, all staﬀ who have any concerns that modern slavery may be
occurring in any part of our organization or supply chain are required to

notify management so the issue can be addressed and we have processes in
place to protect whistleblowers. These processes and policies are reviewed
annually with a view to increase their eﬀectiveness. We also host employee
forums allowing employees yet another route to raise concerns they may
have and to promote openness.

Our Values
Trust, Integrity, Innovation, Openness and Respect: these are the values that
underpin the culture at Autovista Group. These values are core to all that we
do as a business and they set the tone for how we treat each other, our
customers, suppliers, and any other third party.
We hold these values as critically important in how we run the business and,
to reinforce that, we award employees who demonstrate application of our
values in their work.

Awareness
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and
human traﬃcking in our supply chains and our business, our anti-slavery and
human traﬃcking policy is available on the Group’s intranet.
We have also invested in two mandatory interactive one-day training courses
for all employees across the Group covering a) our company values and b)
understanding governance risk & compliance.
To raise awareness of our activities in relation to preventing modern slavery
externally, we have also referenced our last modern slavery statement in our
Group UK consolidated annual ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31
December 2019.

Further Steps
Following a review of the eﬀectiveness of the steps we have taken so far, we
intend to take the following further actions during 2020 and beyond to help
prevent slavery and human traﬃcking:
We aim to raise even more awareness of the Modern Slavery Act within our
workforce by including a section on its importance in our standard employee
induction process as well as by including the prevention of modern slavery as

a regular agenda item at our employee forum to discuss employee concerns
and suggestions.
As a ﬁrst step and as part of a wider programme to assess modern slavery
and human traﬃcking risks within our supply chain, we plan to review
commitments made by our top suppliers.

Section 54(1)
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act
2015 and constitutes our slavery and human traﬃcking statement for the
ﬁnancial year ending 31 December 2019.

MODERN SLAVERY ACT TRANSPARENCY STATEMENT 2020/21
Post Oﬃce Limited (Post Oﬃce) & Post Oﬃce Management Services Limited (POMS).
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Act. It sets out the steps taken by Post Oﬃce & POMS during year ending
31st March 2020 to mitigate the risks of modern slavery and human traﬃcking in its business and supply chains.
Post Oﬃce and POMS are committed to combating the risk of modern slavery or human traﬃcking in our supply chain and
business operations. We are committed to taking appropriate steps to ensure that everyone who works for Post Oﬃce in any
capacity, beneﬁts from a working environment in which their fundamental rights and freedoms are respected.
This is the fourth statement in which we report on our efforts to mitigate the risks of modern slavery in line with the requirements
of the Act. Our history has seen us focus on the rights and wellbeing of the people who work for Post Oﬃce and for our
suppliers for many years. Our statement provides details of our policies, our approach and the actions we have taken in the
2019/20 ﬁnancial year to strengthen our programme and commitment to respect and uphold people’s fundamental rights and
freedoms.
OUR BUSINESS AND SUPPLY CHAIN
Post Oﬃce is the UK’s largest retail network and the largest ﬁnancial services chain in the UK. We have provided services for
more than 370 years and currently supply a range of essential products and services to communities’ right across the UK.
Our UK Government mandate is to provide at least 11,500 Post Oﬃces, some within certain geographical, demographic and social
criteria that provide a unique operational challenge for Post Oﬃce compared to other wholly commercial retail or ﬁnancial
institutions. We are often at the heart of the local communities, some of which can be challenging environments to operate in.
Post Oﬃce directly controls around 1% of the Network of branches which consumers will generally recognise as the larger
branches often situated in the centre of towns and cities across the UK. The remainder of the branches are managed on an agency
basis by independent small retailers and shop owners operating Post Oﬃce services within their own store. Business owners may

own more than one shop operating Post Oﬃce services and have a range of other non-connected business interests. We also
have agent managed facilities within some larger high street commercial partners, who like the smaller independent retailers,
provide their own trained and friendly staff to provide our Post Oﬃce services to consumers.

Banking services
Post Oﬃce banking services are provided in Post Oﬃce branches on behalf of the customers of UK banks.

Postmasters
Postmasters can operate one or more branches. As agents they have full control over how their branches within their retail
premises are run on a daily basis. All those working in an agency Post Oﬃce branch are employed directly by the retailer. The
Retailer is self-employed and typically takes on a Post Oﬃce as a valuable community service provided within their own retail
business. Post Oﬃce has no direct control over the operation of these independent SME businesses but does have the ability to
influence and inform. Post Oﬃce aims to support Postmasters with their Post Oﬃce operations and influence their behaviours.

Commercial partners
A large proportion of the agency network is managed by commercial partners – corporate retail organisations with familiar fascia
brands who themselves have a multiple number of high street stores.

Trade Unions
In our directly managed branch network, we work closely with the Communications Workers Union (CWU) and Unite (CMA)
Communications Managers Association.

Third Party Suppliers
We also procure products and services from a range of managed suppliers, ranging from small and medium enterprises to large
multinationals. Purchasing for our own managed Post Oﬃces is controlled centrally by the Procurement team who also set the
Supplier Relationship Management standards to ensure our teams maintain a consistent approach to supplier management.
OUR BELIEFS AND PRINCIPLES
Respect for the dignity of the individual and the importance of each individual’s human rights form the basis of the behaviours we
expect in every workplace and are communicated through our Code of Business Standards. We will not accept any form of
discrimination, bullying or harassment. We require all our managers to implement policies designed to ensure equality of
opportunity and inclusion for all Post Oﬃce employees.
OUR POLICIES
We operate a number of policies to ensure we are conducting business in an ethical and transparent manner. These include:

CODE OF BUSINESS STANDARDS
We have a Code of Business Standards which underpins everything we do. The Code is mandatory and extends to everyone
directly employed by Post Oﬃce and is reviewed every 24 months. Although it is reviewed every 2 years, there are ad hoc
changes undertaken when required, with all changes recorded in the policy on people hub.
It requires all of us to act ethically and comply with legal requirements at all times, putting our principles into practice in
everything we do. The Code of Business Standards was updated during the 2018 ﬁnancial year to include references to Modern
Slavery.

WHISTLEBLOWING
We operate a Whistleblowing Policy so that all Post Oﬃce employees know how to raise concerns regarding wrongdoing or
dangerous practices. The policy was updated during the 2019 ﬁnancial year to include references to concerns about Modern
Slavery.
There are a number of ways people can report any concerns regarding slavery or human traﬃcking within Post Oﬃce, by either
contacting the Whistleblowing Oﬃcer or via our anonymous external conﬁdential reporting service ‘Speak Up’ which is regularly
communicated to all employees, suppliers and contractors. This is overseen by our General Counsel (Whistleblowing Oﬃcer).
Every report submitted is assessed and investigated.

RECRUITMENT & ONBOARDING POLICY

Our recruitment and on-boarding policy for Post Oﬃce employees sets out the overarching principles and controls to be
followed and applied to ensure that personnel resourcing is conducted in a fair, open and transparent manner, including
conducting eligibility to work in the UK checks for all employees.

DUE DILLIGENCE PROCEDURES IN RELATION TO SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN OUR BUSINESS AND SUPPLY
CHAIN.
Post Oﬃce/POMS employs solely within the UK.
Our recruitment procedures ensure that all prospective employees are legally entitled to work in the UK. All successful
applicants must produce, on their ﬁrst day, one of the following: their original passport, driving license or birth certiﬁcate.
Additionally, to comply with the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 requirements, if they are from a non-European Economic
Area (EEA) country, evidence of a right to reside and work in the UK must be produced.
We carry out reasonable and practical due diligence in the sourcing of goods and services and ensuring that the Act's obligations
form part of the procurement process. As part of this process we have conducted a review of the criteria used by Post Oﬃce to
evaluate whether suppliers meet Post Oﬃce’s minimum tendering requirements. We have also reviewed our standard form
procurement contracts to ensure that they make explicit reference to the Act, as well as covering other areas of company
information, policies and procedures. This enables the procurement team to assist Business Units to identify and assess any
potential risks relating to the goods or services being procured.
IDENTIFYING, ASSESSING AND MANAGING RISK

WHERE ARE THE RISKS OF MODERN SLAVERY AT POST OFFICE/POMS
Post Oﬃce understands that our procurement of goods and services from third parties carry with it the risk of modern slavery
and human traﬃcking.
We understand that a potential for risk of modern slavery sits within our agency network as there are a large number of people
employed by independent retailers acting as Postmasters (including commercial partners) who are not direct employees of Post
Oﬃce or POMS.

GOVERNANCE
We have a cross-functional steering group through which we develop and coordinate our approach to addressing modern
slavery risks within our operations and supply chain. This group consists of expertise from the legal, procurement, compliance
and operational functions in Post Oﬃce.

TRAINING
We provide annual Compliance Awareness Training to all our employees and postmasters, which is tailored to ensure an
appropriate level of understanding of issues such as modern slavery and the Act's requirements.

Supreme Freight Services Limited Modern Slavery Statement
Statement for Financial Year 2019-2020
Supreme Freight Services Ltd Modern Slavery Statement
Modern Slavery and Human Trafﬁcking Statement
This statement is made on behalf of Supreme Freight Services Ltd pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act
2015 (the ‘Act’) and constitutes our slavery and human trafﬁcking statement for the ﬁnancial year ending July 2020. It
sets out the steps taken by Supreme Freight Services Ltd to prevent modern slavery and human trafﬁcking in our own
operations and supply chains.
Our Business and Structure
Supreme Freight Services Ltd is a leading international shipping and forwarding agent. Established in 1986 as a familyoperated business, we have now been handling international shipments for over 30 years. We import and export freight via
air, road and sea and have customers in the United Kingdom, Europe and Asia.
Supreme Freight Services Limited is privately owned and has its head ofﬁce in Southampton with regional ofﬁces
in Felixstowe, Heathrow, Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
We have a team of 28 professional industry experts (based in the UK) working with our customers to understand every
detail of their shipping needs so that we can create a tailor-made solution that is truly bespoke.
Our Supply Chains and Due Diligence Process
Supreme Freight Services Ltd contracts with customers and suppliers, (including agencies who provide labour) and our
supply chains include receipt of goods direct from manufacturers, customers and their contractors for onward
shipment/delivery.
We are committed to ensuring there is no modern slavery or human trafﬁcking in our supply chain or in any part of our
business and to act ethically and with integrity in all of our business relationships. We continually review, implement and
enforce effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery and human trafﬁcking is not taking place anywhere in our
business or supply chains.
The scale of these supply chains, upstream and downstream, gives us the opportunity to promote respect for human rights
and to make a positive impact on people’s lives.
To ascertain and to mitigate the risk of working with a supplier or contractor who may have slavery in their supply chains
we will continue to conduct due diligence and reviews as follows:

All new contractors or suppliers have to be pre-qualiﬁed through a series of audits and we have
now included Modern Slavery Act compliance into that on-boarding process.
mapping the supply chain broadly to assess particular product or geographical risks of modern
slavery and human trafﬁcking;
evaluating the modern slavery and human trafﬁcking risks of each new supplier.
reviewing on a regular basis all aspects of the supply chain based on the supply chain mapping;
conducting supplier audits or assessments which have a greater degree of focus on slavery and
human trafﬁcking where general risks are identiﬁed;
creating an annual risk proﬁle for each supplier;
Continually monitor potential risk areas List low risk areas and areas considered higher risk and
what we are doing about it
Educate and inform our employees of the type of factors to look out for when dealing with
workers (permanent or temporary) in our supply chain who may be subject to undue inﬂuence
and how to report this
Protect anyone who whistleblows

We expect our suppliers and contractors to demonstrate a zero-tolerance approach to exploitation and to conduct the same
level of commitment to the Modern Slavery Act as we do. To ensure this we conduct regular reviews on our existing
suppliers to ensure they remain compliant with the Act and conduct risk assessments on all new suppliers to ensure
compliance.
As part of our procurement process, we will only engage with suppliers and contractors who conﬁrm their compliance
with the Act. We will write to our suppliers to raise awareness and seeking their conﬁrmation of compliance with the
Modern Slavery Act 2015.
As part of our ongoing commitment, Supreme Freight Services Ltd will, over the next twelve months, continue to monitor
existing (and new) suppliers to ensure compliance with the MSA and Supreme Freight Services Ltd own stringent
controls. It remains a condition of doing business with Supreme Freight Services Ltd that suppliers respect the letter and
spirit of the Modern Slavery Act.
To this end, all new contracts and those renewing, now include a clause requiring that our suppliers, and their
subcontractors, comply with the Act, and include Supreme Freight Services Ltd right to terminate in the instance of any
breach of this obligation.

Supreme Freight Services Ltd has Supplier and Procurement Policies and a Code of Conduct in place to reinforce this
statement.
Within our own operations
Supreme Freight Services Ltd takes the following steps to ensure there is no slavery or human trafﬁcking within its own
operations:
Adherence to relevant employment legislation promotes human rights and largely prevents modern slavery. Supreme
Freight Services Ltd has a responsibility to ensure that workers are not being exploited, that they are safe at work and that
relevant employment, health and safety and human rights laws are adhered to. Employees and contractors are able to raise
a suspected case of slavery or human trafﬁcking within the Company’s own operations by following the Company’s
internal Whistleblowing Policy.
All employees have a contract of employment that sets out the rights and obligations arising from their employment,
including the notice period needed for them to terminate the contract and leave the Company’s employment. Employees
are free to serve notice at any time.

The Company carries out veriﬁcation of an employee’s identity and ongoing right to
work in the UK and does not seek to withhold any of an employee’s identity documents
or passport etc.
The Company pays all its employees at least the national minimum wage and adheres to
all legislation in respect of working time and statutory time off, providing for minimum
amounts of holiday, time off for personal emergencies, sickness and maternity/paternity
leave and minimum rest breaks and periods.

Policies on Modern Slavery
We have a Modern Slavery Policy that reﬂects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business
relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafﬁcking is
not taking place anywhere in our supply chains. This policy is reviewed on an annual basis and updated where required in
line with any changes in the law/regulations.
We also consider the following policies give us strength in avoiding modern slavery or human trafﬁcking under the Act in
our business:

Anti-Bribery
Business Code of Conduct
Equal Opportunities & Diversity

Harassment & Bullying
Public Interest Disclosure (Whistleblowing)
Suppliers and Procurement Code of Conduct
Employee Code of Conduct

In addition Supreme Freight Services Ltd has a Recruitment Policy and Process to ensure all checks and practices are
followed correctly. The company uses only speciﬁed, reputable employment agencies to source labour and always veriﬁes
the practices of any new agency before accepting workers from that agency.
In the UK, a requirement to comply with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 will be contained in our updated supplier contracts
and existing suppliers will be required to comply on renewal.
Measuring effectiveness
To date we have not had any instances of modern slavery or grievances related to modern slavery. We do have policies and
procedures in place should any of these instances arise.
We are introducing a reporting mechanism which details any breaches of our policies, sets out the number of suppliers we
have and their commitment to the modern slavery act and progress against our commitments to eradicate modern slavery.
These reports will be shared with the Board of Directors who have a strong overview of risks and effectiveness. We will
also monitor data pertaining to the training of our employees and suppliers on modern slavery.
Training
To maintain awareness and ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafﬁcking
across our business we have trained relevant members of staff and our Anti-slavery Policy is available to all staff. We
provide annual refresher training to all staff on the Modern Slavery Act.
Supreme Freight Services Ltd ensures that all new joiners to the company are briefed on the Modern Slavery Act 2015 as
part of their induction and are signposted to the relevant policies.
Supreme Freight Services Ltd is has undertaken an awareness-building communications campaign to enable all employees
to understand that slavery and human trafﬁcking is a persistent problem, the risks and signs of slavery and human
trafﬁcking, and the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The campaign was to will raise awareness among all
employees and remind them of their responsibilities. Regular reminders to continue the awareness are communicated to all
employees.
Endorsement
We wholeheartedly endorse the legislation as a crucially important development in tackling slavery and human trafﬁcking
and we will not trade or partner with any business or organisation which is involved in this shocking practice however

remotely or indirectly.
We do not tolerate any conduct that contributes to, encourages or facilitates, human trafﬁcking, child labour, forced or
compulsory labour, or any other human rights abuses.
The board of directors have all approved this statement and appointed a Director to be responsible for it. The board are
fully committed to ensuring no aspect of modern slavery or human trafﬁcking is part of its business operations or its
supply chain operations.

INTRODUCTION

OUR BUSINESS

01

This statement is made pursuant to Section 54 of the
Modern Slavery Act 2015 (“MSA”) and sets out the steps
that Harrods Aviation has taken and is continuing to take in
order to ensure that modern slavery or human trafficking
is not taking place within our business or supply chain.

04

Harrods Aviation is the leading business-aviation
service provider, offering high-quality FBO services
at London Luton and Stansted airports. Both locations
have fully equipped hangars for aircraft maintenance
and engineering.

02

Modern slavery encompasses slavery, servitude, human
trafficking and forced labour. As a leading Fixed Base
Operator (“FBO”), we understand that our stakeholders –
employees, customers, community and investors – expect
us to conduct our operation in a responsible manner. We
have a zero-tolerance approach to any form of modern
slavery and are committed to acting ethically and with
integrity and transparency in all of our business dealings,
and to putting effective systems and controls in place
to safeguard against any form of modern slavery taking
place within our business or supply chain. We aim to
create a positive and long-lasting impact in the workplace,
marketplace, environment and community.

05

Air Harrods offers bespoke aircraft services to
complement those of Harrods Aviation, including carrying
out helicopter maintenance, supplying pilots, brokering
helicopter charters and arranging executive transfers.

06

We employ specialised and highly trained staff and, in
respect of our maintenance and engineering business,
use aviation products which, by necessity, are
manufactured to the highest standards and sourced
from highly reputable suppliers. All such products
undergo rigorous testing and are produced in highstandard environments in accordance with the
requirements of aviation safety regulations.

This statement is made on behalf of Harrods Aviation
Limited and its wholly owned subsidiary Air Harrods
Limited. Harrods Aviation Limited and Air Harrods Limited
are private companies registered in England and Wales
with registered company numbers 2043317 (Harrods
Aviation Limited) and 3165147 (Air Harrods Limited).

07

While we will continue to be vigilant in monitoring our
business to ensure that there is no modern slavery, we
feel that our relatively small size, and the technical and
highly skilled nature of our business, mean that there is
a relatively low risk of any transgression. As at today’s
date, we confirm that we are not aware of modern slavery
taking place in respect of our staff or in our supply chain.

SUPPLY CHAIN

08

Typically, our suppliers are established and prestigious
businesses operating within the global aviation industry,
which have their own detailed social and ethical policies
and processes. We expect all suppliers to maintain
a supply chain that is free from slavery and human
trafficking, and will pay particular attention to any new
or smaller suppliers and those suppliers with whom we
have a closer relationship.

Harrods Aviation and Air Harrods are committed to
creating a working environment that is inclusive and
supportive; that is based on mutual respect and trust;
and where everyone feels valued. Our Equal Opportunities
policy demonstrates our ambition for our staff to enjoy
equal opportunity in an environment that is free from
discrimination, harassment, bullying and victimisation
in all its forms, while promoting dignity and respect
for all employees.
We have robust internal processes and policies in place
to uphold and protect the rights and working conditions
of our staff, and to ensure that all Harrods Aviation and
Air Harrods employees are of working age and that we
are complying with the provisions of the MSA. As well
as our Equal Opportunities policy and policies covering
matters such as recruitment and hours of work,

we maintain and publicise a Disclosing Confidential
Information (Whistleblowing) policy that allows staff
to identify and report any potential concerns through
the appropriate channels.

11

We operate a number of internal policies to ensure that
we are conducting business in an ethical and transparent
manner. These include:
1.

Recruitment Procedure and Referencing & Stansted
Airside Access policies, which require references
covering the last five years. We operate a robust
recruitment policy: this includes conducting
eligibility to work in the UK, and checks for all
employees to safeguard against human trafficking or
individuals being forced to work against their will.

2. Disclosing Confidential Information (Whistleblowing)
policy. We operate a whistleblowing policy so that all
employees know that they can raise concerns about
how colleagues are being treated, or about practices
within our business or supply chain, without fear
of reprisals. These include a confidential hotline
number which can be used anonymously if required.
3. Ethics in Business Policy. This policy explains the
manner in which we behave as an organisation and
how we expect our employees and suppliers to act.
This policy is reviewed annually and distributed to
all employees to read.

12

We recognise that our business and supply chain require
constant monitoring for risks of modern slavery. During
FY 2018/2019 our key focuses for Harrods Aviation and
Air Harrods will be to:
• raise awareness of modern slavery issues by:
– introducing the topic of modern slavery to our
		 induction training for new starters
– providing training on the topic of modern
		 slavery to existing employees

Q-Pulse system
• formalise a process detailing the steps to be taken
in the event that modern slavery risks are identified
within our business or supply chain, and to circulate
this to all employees via our Q-Pulse system

These steps will help to ensure that employees understand
the basic principles of the MSA and will encourage them
to flag up potential slavery or human-trafficking issues to
the relevant parties within the organisation. We believe
that this process will help to develop Harrods Aviation’s
and Air Harrods’ effectiveness at mitigating human
trafficking and promoting anti-slavery.

This statement reflects the philosophy of Harrods
Aviation Limited and Air Harrods Limited and the work
undertaken to date to ensure that slavery and human
trafficking are not taking place in our business or supply

It has been published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and details the
action taken by PROMAN to prevent and combat modern slavery and human trafficking
within our business and supply chain.
Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights which is estimated
to effect c.21 million victims worldwide. It takes various forms; slavery, servitude, forced
and bonded labour; and human trafficking; all of which have in common the deprivation of
a person’s liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain.
In 2019, 10,627 potential victims of modern slavery were referred to the NRM; a 52%
increase from 20181, the PROMAN Staffing Group recognises the need to raise awareness
and to be proactive in working to prevent all aspects of modern slavery.
We are committed to acting transparently, ethically and with integrity in all our business
transactions and relationships, and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and
controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our business or in our
supply chains.

POLICY STATEMENT
Proman commits to developing and adopting a proactive approach to tackling hidden labour
exploitation. Hidden labour exploitation is exploitation of job applicants or workers by
third party individuals or gangs other than the employer or labour provider including rogue
individuals working within these businesses but without the knowledge of management.
It includes forced labour and human trafficking for labour exploitation; payment for workfinding services and work-related exploitation such as the forced use of accommodation. It
is understood that it is often well hidden by the perpetrators with victims if they perceive of
themselves as such, reluctant to come forward.
PROMAN have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and expect all who have, or
seek to have, a business relationship with PROMAN, to familiarise themselves with our antislavery and human trafficking policy and to act at all times in a way which is consistent with
this policy.

COVERAGE

RESPONSIBILITY
The Compliance Director and members of the Compliance Team are responsible for the
deployment of this policy and accompanying procedures to Branch Managers, Account
Managers, Payroll staff and our Clients.

have responsibility for developing and operating company procedures relevant to this
issue.

applicants. The Company will not use any individual or organisation to source and supply
workers without confirming that workers are not being charged a work finding fee.
3. Ensure that all staff responsible for directly recruiting workers are aware of issues
around third-party labour exploitation and signs to look for and have signed appropriate
Compliance Principles.
4. Ensure that labour sourcing, recruitment and worker placement processes are under the
control of trusted and competent staff members.
5. Adopt a proactive approach to reporting suspicions of hidden worker exploitation to the
Gangmasters Licensing Authority and police.
6. Provide information on tackling “Hidden Labour Exploitation” to our employees and
our Agency Worker workforce through a variety of formats such as workplace posters,
worker leaflets, inductions, and assignment information.
7. Encourage workers to report cases of hidden third party labour exploitation, provide the
means to do so and investigate and act on reports appropriately.
8. Positively encourage and support employees and agency workers to report such
exploitation which may be occurring within their communities (detail how).
9. Require labour providers and other organisations in the labour supply chain to adopt
policies and procedures consistent with the above.
This statement is made as part of Proman’s commitment to eliminating the exploitation of
people under the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the Act). It summarises how Proman operates,

OUR PROCESSES FOR MANAGING RISK
In order to assess the risk of modern slavery, we use the following processes with our
suppliers:
f

When engaging with suppliers, we ask for evidence of their processes and policies,
including commitments around modern slavery, human trafficking, forced labour,
human rights, and whistle-blowing.

f

We conduct audits before entering into a commercial relationship with any business
where there is the potential for risk. These audited businesses form the basis of our
preferred supplier list.

f

We review the potential for risk at regular intervals, including the possibility of reauditing a supplier or conducting spot checks.

After due consideration, we have identified the following potential risks in our supply chain:
f

Sector risks, because there may be substantially different working practices between
different sectors,

f

Business partnership risks, acknowledging that different relationships your business
has may have different risks associated with them. This can involve a variety of
factors including knowledge and familiarity with the other business’s working
practices, the length of the relationship, and any due diligence (audits etc.) you have
conducted.

Additionally, we have taken the following steps to minimise the possibility of any problems:
f

We reserve the right to conduct spot-checks of the businesses who supply us, in
order to investigate any complaints.

f

We require the businesses we work with to address modern slavery concerns in their
policies.

f

We collaborate with our suppliers in order to improve standards and transparency
across our supply chain.

working groups.

f

We work with “Stronger Together”, “Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA)”
and the “Recruitment and Employment Confederation” in order to combat the risk of

Introduction
This statement sets out Holidaybreak’s actions to understand all potential modern slavery risks related to its
individual businesses and to put in place steps that are aimed at ensuring that there is no slavery or human
trafficking in its individual business and their supply chains. This statement relates to actions and activities during
the financial year 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016.
As part of the travel industry, Holidaybreak recognises that it has a responsibility to take a robust approach to
slavery and human trafficking. Holidaybreak is committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking in its
corporate activities and within its individual businesses, in order to ensure that its supply chains are free from
slavery and human trafficking.

Countries of operation and supply

The Education Division and the Meininger Division currently operates in the following countries:
UK, France and Spain; and
Amsterdam /The Netherlands, Brussels/ Belgium, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Cologne, Berlin, Munich / Germany,
London, United Kingdom, Salzburg and Vienna / Austria.
Risk Assessment Process

The following is the process by which the company assesses whether or not particular activities or countries are
high risk in relation to slavery or human trafficking:
Modern Slavery Act meetings have taken place across the business, including at parent level the
attendance of Holidaybreak directors at a senior management workshop with external consultants, as well
as a 'top up meeting' within the individual businesses where their action plans were developed;
A Slavery Risk form detailing potential roles and areas within the business where slavery and human
trafficking may exist was distributed from Holidaybreak to be completed by our individual businesses. A
risk rating system (1 low risk, 5 high risk) was allocated to each potential risk; and
A contractual clause on the MSA Act for inclusion within supplier contracts has been distributed from
Holidaybreak to our businesses. Zero tolerance for modern slavery and respect for human rights will be
built into supplier contracts and also represented in dialogue, sub-contractors, customers and other
business partners.
High-risk activities

As a non-operational entity, Holidaybreak does not view any of its activities as high risk. Low and medium
risks are identified in our individual businesses' Statement, links to their Statements are provided at the
end of this Statement.

Relevant policies
Holidaybreak operates the following policies that describe its approach to the identification of modern slavery
risks and steps to be taken to prevent slavery and human trafficking in its operations:

Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy In accordance with the MSA Act,

Holidaybreak has adopted a group led policy relating to anti-slavery and human trafficking. The policy
confirms Holidaybreak's commitment to tackling slavery and human trafficking throughout our supply
chains and to ensuring transparency in Holidaybreak's individual businesses. We expect the same high
standards from our businesses, contractors, suppliers and other business partners.
Anti-Bribery & Whistleblowing policy Holidaybreak encourages all its employees,
customers and other business partners to report any concerns related to the direct activities, or the supply
chains of, any of its individual businesses. This includes any circumstances that may give rise to an
enhanced risk of slavery or human trafficking. Holidaybreak's whistleblowing procedure is designed to
make it easy for employees at any level to make disclosures, without fear of retaliation.

Due diligence
Key Performance indicators
Holidaybreak has requested each business to review its key performance indicators (KPI's) in light of the
introduction of the MSA Act. As a result, specific KPI's have been identified to measure supplier effectiveness and
compliance following the implementation of the MSA Act by:

developing a system for supply chain verification in place since June 2016, whereby the organisation
evaluates potential new suppliers before they enter the supply chain; and
reviewing its existing supply chains expected to be completed by over the next number of years, whereby
the organisation evaluates all its existing suppliers.

Training
Holidaybreak has required each of its businesses to complete introductory training on modern slavery to staff
and, if appropriate, will update this on regular occasions throughout the year.
Holidaybreak's modern slavery training covers:
the basic principles of the MSA Act;
a MSA Act training presentation (including a video presentation, memo and supporting guidance
documents), giving the methodology of how we as a business ensure adherence to the MSA Act;
an overview of our divisional purchasing practices, which influence supply chain conditions and which
should therefore be designed to prevent purchases at unrealistically low prices, the use of labour engaged
on unrealistically low wages or wages below a country's national minimum wage, or the provision of
products by an unrealistic deadline; and
what steps should be taken if slavery or human trafficking is suspected.

Board approval
This statement has been approved by Holidaybreak's board of directors, who will review and update it annually.

The Modern Slavery Act 2015
Our hospitals have zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking and we are committed to ensuring that there is no
modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our service. We are fully aware of the
responsibilities it bears towards patients, employees and the local community and as such, we have a strict set of
ethical values that we use as guidance with regard to our commercial activities. We therefore expect that all of our
suppliers to adhere to the same ethical principles.
The summary below sets out the steps the we are taking to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking
place in our supply chains or in any part of our service:
• Assessing risk related to human trafficking and forced labour associated with our supply base: we do this by supply
chain mapping and developing risk-ratings on labour practices of our suppliers to understand which markets are most
vulnerable to slavery risk.
• Developing a ‘Supplier Code of Conduct’: we will issue our Supplier Code of Conduct to our existing key suppliers as
well as those that are in a market perceived to be of a higher risk (for example, Catering, Cleaning, Clothing and
Construction). The Supplier Code of Conduct will also be included within our tendering process.
• Monitoring supplier compliance with the Code of Conduct: we will request confirmation from all our existing and new
suppliers that they are compliant with our Supplier Code of Conduct.
• Monitoring supplier compliance with the Act: we will request confirmation from our key suppliers that they are
compliant with the Act.
• Training and provision of advice and support for our staff: we are further developing our advice and training about
slavery and human trafficking for Trust staff through our Safeguarding Team to increase awareness of the issues and
how staff should tackle them.
• Monitoring contracts: we continually review the employment or human rights contract clauses in supplier contracts.
• Addressing non-compliance: we will assess any instances of non-compliance with the Act on a case-by-case basis
and will then tailor remedial action appropriately.
Although the Lancashire Teaching Hospitals are not formally subject to the disclosure obligations under the Act, it
recognises the importance of these issues for all its stakeholders.
Directors’ declaration
All directors have confirmed that, so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the auditor is
not aware and that they have taken all steps that they ought to have taken as a director in order to make themselves
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the NHS foundation trust’s auditor is aware of that
information.
All directors understand that it is their responsibility to prepare the annual report and accounts, and that they consider
the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable, and to provide the
information necessary for patients, regulators and other stakeholders to assess the performance of Lancashire
Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, including our business model and strategy.

Statement 2017
Note: This Statement is made pursuant to section 54(i) of the UK
Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes the Modern Slavery
Statement 2017 for ERM Worldwide Group Ltd and its global
subsidiaries.

ERM has a longstanding
commitment to ethical business
conduct in our operations and
supply chains, and is opposed to all
forms of corruption and unethical
business conduct. We are
particularly strong supporters of the
international effort to abolish all
forms of modern slavery.
Accordingly, ERM provides our
second Modern Slavery Statement
wherein we provide an overview of
the approach and tools we have in
place to prevent modern slavery in
our business and supply chains (in
more detail than we provided in our
first Statement), and describe the
specific actions that we have taken
in the past fiscal year. This
Statement also notes our next steps
on this topic planned for the fiscal
year ending 31 March 2018.

The business of sustainability

Summary of Actions taken during fiscal year ending 31
March, 2017
The specific actions that ERM has taken during the fiscal
year ending 31 March 2017 to progress our efforts can be
summarised as follows:
We have:
• improved and expanded our global subcontractor
standards and systems;
• as part of our internal audit and risk assessment
program, performed risk assessments on corruption
risks (including human rights abuses) and provided
preliminary education on modern slavery in some of
the higher risk locations where we have offices: Brazil,
China and Sub-Saharan Africa (South Africa,
Mozambique and Kenya);
• updated our values to include ‘caring for our people’
to underline the absolute priority that we have always
maintained for the safety and health of our employees,
as well as our strong focus around the growth and
development of our employees;
• increased the work we do with our clients to help
them understand where risks of human rights abuse
may appear in their operations or supply chains, how
they can improve their performance to avoid these
risks from occurring, and/or how they might remedy
any cases if discovered;
• carried out external engagement to inform and
educate ERM about international best practices to
eliminate modern slavery as well using this
information to evolve our own approach; and,
• introduced better strategic oversight of our efforts and
planning for actions to be taken in respect of modern
slavery in the next fiscal year.

Our Business
ERM is a leading global provider of sustainability
consultancy services, including environmental, health,
safety, risk, social and human rights consulting services.
As a professional services firm that has operated for more
than 45 years, our people are our greatest asset. We have
more than 160 offices in over 40 countries and territories.
The Board of Directors and Executive Committee are
ERM's highest governing bodies. Our operational and
governance structure is further detailed in our
Sustainability Policy.
While our business is structured on a corporate model and
is not a partnership in the legal sense, we use the term
“Partner” to designate our top executives and leaders.
ERM is led by approximately 550 Partners and at any given
time, we have between 4,500 to 5,000 people working on
projects for clients around the world.
We provide both office-based services and on-site work all
over the world. Our work takes us to manufacturing
plants, construction sites, mine sites, offshore and onshore
rigs, agricultural and rural areas. We provide services to
clients in many countries and in all types of industries,
with a focus on the following key sectors: Oil and Gas,
Mining, Power, Manufacturing, Technology, Media and
Telecommunications, Chemical and Pharmaceutical, and
Banking and Finance.
As part of our work we also act as advisors to multinational corporations on human rights and the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). In our consulting work over
the past fiscal year, ERM has seen a significant increase in
the work we do with our clients to help them understand
where risks of human rights abuses may appear in their
operations or supply chains, how they can improve their

The business of sustainability

performance to avoid these risks from occurring, and/or
how they might remedy any cases if discovered.
Our Supply Chain
Our supply chains include various forms of capital
(human, financial and physical), and goods and services.
As a professional services firm, our people (human capital)
are our greatest asset. Financial capital enables us to grow
our business, while physical capital includes our 160
offices and site-based facilities. We require goods and
services for our global offices and to support our delivery
of projects to clients, including travel management,
technical and personal protection equipment, office and IT
equipment, facilities and maintenance providers as well as
specialist support from subcontractors.
Because ERM is a services company and not a products
company, we have decided to focus our modern slavery
efforts on subcontracted services as they are our primary
supply chain. Since 2008, ERM has required our global
subcontractors to commit to our anti-bribery/corruption
standards, which include the abolition of slavery and
human trafficking. As noted in our 2017 Sustainability
Report, in the last fiscal year supply chain management of
our subcontractors has continued to be a key focus for us.
Our Policies
As we noted in our 2016 Modern Slavery Act Statement,
when the Modern Slavery Act 2015 was enacted, ERM
updated our Slavery, Child Labour and Human
Trafficking Policy in line with the terminology of that Act.
Accordingly, our policy prohibits the use of child or forced
labour in our business and any involvement by ERM with
organisations that support prohibited labour practices or
human trafficking. This policy works in conjunction with
ERM’s Vision and Values and Code of Business Conduct
and Ethics wherein we express our corporate philosophy

of how we conduct business and provide the basis for
professional, respectful and fair dealings in our daily
operations. Additionally, ERM maintains a compliance
reporting site, which offers a means for reporting or
raising concerns about any wrongdoing to the Group
Compliance Officer, in confidence and without fear of
retaliation.
ERM’s Sustainability Policy and Sustainability Approach
articulate our commitments to sustainability, and ERM
became a signatory of the UN Global Compact in 2011. As
part of our ongoing support for the protection of
international human rights, we have continued to use our
UN commitment and other international developments as
a basis to improve our policies, procedures, and approach
to business. Our policy framework and corporate
governance disclosures associated with the Ten Principles
of the UN Global Compact, which include points on anticorruption and human rights, are mapped in ERM’s 2017
Sustainability Report along with further details of
operational and governance structure.
Our Partners use our vision, values, policies, and internal
governance arrangements to lead an ERM culture based on
sustainability principles, including fair labour and human
rights. Our ability to attract, develop, reward and retain
talented employees is central to our business strategy and
vital to our future. As part of ERM’s new corporate
Strategy, which we started rolling out in May 2016, we
updated our values to include ‘caring for our people’ to
underline the absolute priority that we have always
maintained for the safety and health of our employees, as
well as our strong focus on the growth and development of
our employees. ERM strives to provide a work
environment where all employees have an equal
opportunity to reach their full potential and contribute to
our success.

The business of sustainability

Our Due Diligence and Risk Management Efforts
ERM has processes in place to support on-going
assessment and management of risks associated with our
direct business operations and business relationships. We
do not work with clients, suppliers or sub-contractors
whom we know not to share our commitment to high
ethical standards, and we would correct any situation if
cases were ever discovered.
ERM believes that the greatest potential for risk to human
rights (and for modern slavery) exists with our
subcontractors and suppliers.
ERM’s Global Contractor Management Program provides
a centrally managed global process for prequalifying
contractors, collecting relevant information for more
effective decision-making and risk reduction, and adding
value to services provided to our clients by reducing their
risk around our use of contractors. As the program is
implemented around the world, it provides a consistent
approach for mandating contractors to adhere to the
requirements of our policies– including a prohibition on
the use of forced and slave labour – and to track their
compliance. During our fiscal year ending 31 March 2017,
we have extended the program to additional geographies
and piloted a tailored approach for smaller sub contractors.
Suppliers of goods and services for our offices are
managed separately by our business units.
We recognize different geographic locations and sectors
present higher risks of slavery and human trafficking than
others. For this reason ERM has been performing
assessments on corruption risks, including human rights
abuses, as part of our internal audit and risk assessment
program since 2011. The assessments have focused
primarily on recognized industry and geographic
corruption risks faced by our staff in numerous

jurisdictions ranked as “high risk” on the Transparency
International Corruption Perception Index. Based on our
assessments over the past several years, ERM believes that
the risk of slavery and human trafficking within our
employed staff is negligible. This conclusion is also based
on our global commitment to the recruitment of highly
skilled professionals, our commitment to ensuring the
safety and security of our workforce, the monitoring and
auditing of our global employment practices, as well as the
education of our staff on ethics, management expectations,
and international standards.

engagements related to modern slavery in the last year.
Examples include:
•

•

•
•

During our last fiscal year, ERM performed risk
assessments, as well as preliminary education on modern
slavery in some of the higher risk locations where we have
offices: Brazil, China and Sub-Saharan Africa (South
Africa, Mozambique and Kenya) operations. From a base
of publicly available materials relating to modern slavery
risks around the world, as well as our general inquiries, we
determined key risk issues to focus on in each jurisdiction.
We conducted interviews of ERM staff from all levels and
functions within these businesses. We then examined
internationally recognized risks and data in the context of
ERM business risk. The risk assessments last year covered
different risk perspectives for geography (including urban
vs rural), industry, types of humanitarian
abuses/corruption, and the type of ERM service.
Our global programs, as described above, help us to
manage these risks. In addition, we are exploring ways we
might improve our identification of modern slavery and
leverage our influence to remediate cases if ever found.

This external engagement enables ERM to contribute to
international best practices to eliminate modern slavery
and we are using this information to evolve our own
approach.
Our Next Steps
This year we have reviewed how to improve our strategic
oversight for modern slavery risk assessments and actions
within our business, as part of our compliance and
assurance program. For the fiscal year ending 31 March
2018, we are intending to evolve our commitment and
endeavours related to modern slavery as follows:
•
•

Our External Engagement
In addition to our work for clients on modern slavery
matters and the external supply chain engagement
described above, ERM participated in a number of external

The business of sustainability

participation in the Working Group on Modern
Slavery facilitated by the UK chapter of the United
Nations Global Compact;
participation in a World Business Council on
Sustainable Development (WBCSD) workshop on
Human Rights and Business in the UK;
chairing a conference on Conflict Minerals, including
slavery in mineral supply chains;
attending and reporting on the 60th Session of the UN
Commission on the Status of Women (CSW60) on
Women’s Empowerment and Sustainable
Development.

•

develop and implement global slavery awareness
training for all staff;
continue to do geographic corruption risk assessments
as part of our internal audit governance focused on
high risk areas;
continue to expand and improve subcontractor
management in the many jurisdictions where we have
offices;

•
•

•

develop a code of conduct for our suppliers;
continue to protect the rights of our staff through
robust policies and procedures and evolve our
approach to diversity in the business; and,
expand our work with clients and maintain active
involvement in industry forums and working groups
to promote the elimination of slavery around the
world.

We will provide detail on progress made and our
performance in next year’s Statement.
ERM is committed to the goal of respect for human rights
and a world free of slavery, and in furtherance of this goal,
we will make efforts that extend beyond our own
immediate organizational interests. Not only will we
continue to set internal goals, we will also participate in
building external standards and providing education so
that momentum not only builds in our sphere of business
influence but beyond, fully aligned with our purpose of
shaping a more sustainable future with the world’s leading
organisations.

Modern slavery and human traﬃcking
statement
Introduction
Comfort Call Ltd (“the group”) is part of City and County Healthcare Group, which has made
explicit in its Modern Slavery Policy its commitment to ensuring that its business and supply
chains are free of the exploitative practices of slave labour and human trafficking
This statement provides contextual information on the group and its operations and supply chains
and explains what has been done in the financial year 2018-19 to ensure that the group does not
support modern slavery or human trafficking in any way.
The group acknowledges that at this stage the tangible actions it has taken are limited, but as
detailed in the Modern Slavery Policy, the group intends to take further actions over the coming
years to give effect to its stated commitment to ethical business operations.
This statement has been written to give effect to s.54(9) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

Context
City and County Healthcare Group is a group of companies (including Comfort Call Ltd), which
provide community-based health and social care support services across the United Kingdom,
mostly under contract to the public sector. Personal care for older and disabled people living in
their own homes makes up the large part of the services provided, but companies in the group
also provide some more complex, specialised support, including health care.
The group operates to all intents and purposes as a single organisation with one management
structure and a single policy framework, governance arrangements and supply chain (see below).
.
The group’s staff are directly employed and enjoy full employment rights under UK law. Most
front-line employees delivering care are employed on a flexible basis without guaranteed hours of
work, but work is typically consistent throughout the year and is not seasonal.

Supply chain

As a provider of services in the community, the group’s procurement needs are relatively simple,
covering mostly:
Rental, furnishing, equipping and maintenance of local offices (including utilities);
Implementation and maintenance of IT and communication systems;
Equipment, uniforms and supplies for care workers;
Marketing and communications;
Recruitment and HR;
Accommodation, travel and other routine business needs;
Legal, accountancy and consultancy.
The group does not currently use any non-UK suppliers directly.

What we did in 2018-19
In the financial year 2018-19, as part of its overall development of supply chain transparency, the
group introduced routine checks on the arrangements its suppliers have in place for eliminating
any modern slavery and human trafficking from its supply chains. It achieved this by:
Reviewing and updating its probity and sustainability policies, both of which include specific
references to modern slavery;
Reviewing and updating its safeguarding and whistleblowing policies, both of which include
references to modern slavery;
Including modern slavery and human trafficking awareness in care worker training, to equip
them to identify signs of such practices in the communities in which they deliver care;
Requesting that all its suppliers complete a supplier questionnaire detailing the arrangements
they have in place in respect of eliminating modern slavery and human trafficking from their
supply chains.

What we are doing in 2019-20
In the financial year 2019-20, the group will:
Update its supplier policy to including a supplier code, giving effect to its probity, sustainability
and modern slavery policies;
Ensure that all existing suppliers have completed an ethical supply chains survey, including
reference to modern slavery and human trafficking;
End relationships with suppliers that are unwilling or unable to comply with the supplier code
or that are found to be involved in modern slavery or human trafficking (or other unethical
business conduct);
Provide training for those with procurement responsibilities covering modern slavery in
general and the systems and practices described above.

Circle Clinical Services Limited
Circle Nottingham Limited
Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 2017
1: Introduction
Circle Health Holdings Limited is the holding company for Circle Health Limited, a UK healthcare group (the “Circle”) operating
hospitals and providing clinical services to NHS-funded, self-paying, and privately-insured patients.
Circle is committed to preventing acts of modern slavery and human trafficking within its business and supply chain, and requires
that its suppliers are similarly committed. To this end, we undertake the following steps to ensure we comply with relevant UK
legislation and to mitigate the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking occurring in our supply chain, including:
•

conducting due diligence process of all our existing suppliers;

•

complying with our Modern Slavery Policy (“MSP”) when setting out our audit, monitoring, and reporting processes;
and

•

incorporating the key elements of our MSP into contractual approach to engaging new suppliers.

2: Policies
As part of our commitment to combating modern slavery, we have adopted an MSP and a Whistleblowing Policy. As we work
with a range of suppliers to provide high quality healthcare services to our patients, we also seek to ensure our suppliers are
aware of our MSP and adhere to the same high standards that we do.

3: Due diligence
As part of our efforts to monitor and reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring within our supply chains, Circle
has a documented process for approving third-party suppliers. Circle requires suppliers to complete a questionnaire confirming
their compliance with quality, environmental aspects, health and safety, information security, equal opportunities, recruitment
standards, and other relevant aspects. A full supplier review process is completed before appointment or on contract renewal,
and ad hoc reviews are undertaken if any concerns arise. Our Modern Slavery Questionnaire forms an additional part of the
overall review process and, where it flags up any concerns, we investigate further before we decide whether to engage that
supplier. We maintain an Approved Supplier Register that records all vetted third-party suppliers to the business.
Our procedures are designed to:
•

establish and assess areas of potential risk in our business and supply chains;

•

monitor potential risk areas in our business and supply chains;

•

reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our business and supply chains; and

•

provide adequate protection for whistle-blowers.

4: Risk and compliance
Circle regularly evaluates the nature and extent of its exposure to the risk of modern slavery occurring in its supply chain by
annual reviews of existing and new business areas and any affected policies.

Overall, we consider the healthcare sector to be low risk for acts of slavery and human trafficking, apart from single-use surgical
instruments and uniform suppliers and outsourced support functions, which are medium risk areas. All current suppliers have
been thoroughly assessed and are marked low risk in the Approved Supplier Register.
We will continue to ensure all our suppliers adhere to our MSP. We enforce a strict code of compliance and do not tolerate
slavery and human trafficking within our supply chains. Where warranted, we will exercise our right to terminate our
relationship with the supplier if we become aware that it has failed to comply with modern slavery legislation.

5: Effectiveness and KPIs
Circle uses key performance indicators (KPIs) annually to measure how successful we have been in ensuring that slavery and
human trafficking are not taking place in any part of our business or supply chains. These are as follows for 2017:
•

number of known incidents of slavery and human trafficking linked to Circle either by its operations, business relationships
or supply chain (currently nil);

•

percentage and number of suppliers investigated on suspicion of human trafficking and slavery (nil);

•

percentage and number of suppliers signed up to Circle MSP requirements (100%/289); and

•

percentage of procurement and HR staff trained on the issue of human trafficking and slavery and the application of our
MSP (100%).

6: Training
Our employees are required to act in line with our policies (including MSP) that promote integrity and respect for each other.
Our Circle Credo stresses that “everyone matters”, irrespective of their job or background. Further training is provided to
procurement and HR teams. It covers modern slavery and human trafficking and includes information on where the risks lie and
how to minimise and prevent them. Employees are taught the benefits of stringent measures to tackle slavery and human
trafficking, as well as the consequences of failing to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our business and supply chains.

7: Further actions and sign-off
Following our review of our actions this financial year to prevent slavery or human trafficking from occurring in our business or
supply chains, we intend to continue reviewing KPIs annually and monitoring the robustness of the systems and controls we
have in place.
This statement is made in accordance with section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes Circle's slavery and
human trafficking statement for the financial year commencing 1 January 2017 and ending 31 December 2017.

Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
The Modern Slavery Act 2015 requires commercial organisations supplying goods or services with a
turnover of above £36 million to prepare and publish an annual ‘Slavery and Human Trafficking
Statement’. The Statement must set out the steps an organisation has taken, if any, during its financial
year to ensure that slavery or human trafficking is not taking place in its supply chain.

What is Modern Slavery
Modern slavery is an international crime, affecting an estimated 29.8 million slaves around the world. It is a
growing global issue that transcends age, gender and ethnicities. It includes victims who have been brought from
overseas and vulnerable people in the UK, who are forced to illegally work against their will across many different
sectors such as agriculture, hospitality, construction, retail and manufacturing.

Our Policy
Wasdell Group is working towards establishing a zero-tolerance position on violations of anti​human trafficking
and anti-modern slavery laws. This statement explains the steps we intend to take, to ensure that slavery and
human trafficking is not taking place in any of our supply chains or any part of our business. If we do find
breaches of these laws within our supply chain, we will look to support companies in their efforts to comply with
the legislation or change our suppliers if necessary.

Our Structure and Supply Chains
The Wasdell Group is composed of four companies operating from three locations across the UK and Ireland,
currently employing over 577 direct employees and 90 agency workers:
Wasdell Packaging Ltd: Swindon, UK: approx. 450 permanent employees and 90 agency workers;
Wasdell Manufacturing Ltd: Newcastle, UK: approx. 70 permanent employees;
Wasdell Europe Ltd: Dundalk, Ireland: approx. 30 permanent employees;
Honeywood Ltd., Wellingborough, UK: approx. 27 permanent employees.
The Wasdell Group is one of the largest and most experienced contract packaging suppliers to the
pharmaceutical and healthcare industry in Europe. It provides a full range of storage, fulfillment and distribution

services tailored to customer needs, and our pharmaceutical manufacturing site in Newcastle offers flexible
solutions to customers with non-sterile manufacturing requirements. The facility in Ireland will offer QC import
testing, a variety of current and novel packaging technologies as well as storage and distribution, and the recent
acquisition of Honeywood Ltd. will increase capacity and service offerings in the UK an enable better service to a
growing client base in the US.
Our supply chain is predominantly the UK domestic market (500 suppliers) together with some European
suppliers (20) and 2 or 3 suppliers from the US.
Our suppliers are usually pre-approved suppliers dictated by our customers. For example, our suppliers in the US
provide a health and nutritional product dictated by a specific customer.
The Wasdell Group use only three suppliers of labour resource in the form of three agencies across the UK.
Employment
The Wasdell Group has a number of internal HR policies which are available to all staff, and these can also be
accessed by third parties on request by contacting Darren Radford at info@wasdell.co.uk. These policies include
Equal Opportunities, Dignity at Work and Whistleblowing. Our whistleblowing procedures encourage anyone
who might have concerns, for example, about how staff or our supplier partners are behaving, to raise them in a
confidential manner. This procedure can also be used in respect of any suspicions an individual might have in
relation to modern slavery. Our policies are reviewed annually by the organisation’s legal advisors, to ensure we
remain compliant.
As part of the organisation’s induction process and throughout our employees’ employment with us, we train all
employees to treat others with respect and courtesy as well as ensuring they adhere to all relevant laws,
regulations and standards. This is an ongoing due diligence process. We offer a training and development
programme for all staff. We focus on ensuring our management team is not only aware of the requirements to be
alert to modern slavery but can also address concerns raised by their team or any suppliers. If any employee is
found in breach of our policies, we ensure suitable disciplinary action is taken which can include termination of
employment.
All right to work documentation is checked for permanent employees, contracts of employment are provided to
all new starters and market-related pay is provided to all employees which will at all times meet national living
and minimum wage rates set by the Government.
Suppliers
In relation to our supply chains, we have carried out a risk assessment to identify our tier 1 suppliers and main
providers of agency workers.
With regards to Agency suppliers, all Managers within the Group are aware of the agreed list of three Agency
supply companies. Managers are not permitted to engage with any other labour resource suppliers without
express permission of the Finance Director who will ensure relevant due diligence is carried out before engaging
them.
Signed agency supplier contracts are issued which obliges the agencies to comply with eligibility to work checks,
national minimum wage compliance, MSA compliance and anti-bribery compliance.
Furthermore, all tier 1 suppliers, including our agency suppliers are issued with a letter requesting a response
confirming their own modern slavery and anti-human trafficking policies. If any risks are identified then further
investigations will be carried out and any necessary action will be taken.

Going Forward
We have rolled out a new induction programme within which there is a greater emphasis on conducting right to
work checks and ensuring that all new starters remain eligible to work in the UK. Inducting managers have
received expert coaching in this process and have received training in modern slavery and human trafficking.

We are continuing to increase visibility of modern slavery and human trafficking across our sites and have put
information posters up in our communal areas. These provide our employees with general information about the
issues, and provide them with support and guidance and an impartial helpline number.
Work is still being undertaken to develop a procedure as part of our Quality Audits with our tier 1 suppliers to
assess their compliance with the MSA 2015, and risk assessments will be carried out our tier 2 suppliers
throughout the next 6 – 12 months.
As part of our procurement process with suppliers, we now request suppliers to certify that they do not
participate in any forced or involuntary labour with their workers, subcontractors, agents or associates.
This statement is made pursuant to Section 54, Part 6 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 for the financial year ended
31st March 2018. It has been approved by the Board of Directors, who will review it on an annual basis making
updates as necessary.

Introduction
This statement sets out Hills Garages (Woodford) Limited’s actions to understand all potential modern slavery risks related to its
business and to put in place steps that are aimed at ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafficking in its own business and its
supply chains. This statement relates to actions and activities during the financial year 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019.
As part of the new and used car sales industry, the Company recognises that it has a responsibility to take a robust approach to
slavery and human trafficking. The Company is absolutely committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking in its corporate
activities, and to ensuring that its supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking.
Organisational structure and supply chains
This statement covers the activities of Hills Garages (Woodford) Limited.
The business activities of the Company are new and Toyota approved used car sales; new and used Lexus sales; and servicing
and parts for Toyota and Lexus. The Company operates within the Essex area including Ilford, Epping and East London (Toyota and
Lexus), and Southend and Chelmsford (Lexus).
The Company’s main supplier is Toyota / Lexus in the UK in respect of both cars and parts. The Company also sub-contracts
bodyshop work to smaller suppliers.
Countries of operation and supply
The Company currently operates in the UK only.
High-risk activities
The Company considers that it performs no activities which carry a high risk of slavery or
human trafficking:
Responsibility
Responsibility for the Company's anti-slavery initiatives is as follows:
Policies: The Financial Director is responsible for putting in place and reviewing policies and the process by which they were
developed.
Risk assessments: The Financial Director is responsible for human rights and modern slavery risk analysis.
Investigations/due diligence: The Financial Director is responsible for investigations and due diligence in relation to known or
suspected instances of slavery and human trafficking.
Training: The Financial Director is responsible for training directly within the Company to better understand and respond to any
identified slavery and human trafficking risks.

Relevant policies
The Company operates the following policies that describe its approach to the identification of modern slavery risks and steps to be
taken to prevent slavery and human trafficking in its operations:
Whistleblowing policy The Company encourages all its workers, customers and other business partners to report any concerns
related to the direct activities, or the supply chains of, the Company. This includes any circumstances that may give rise to an
enhanced risk of slavery or human trafficking. The Company's whistleblowing
procedure is designed to make it easy for workers to make disclosures, without fear of retaliation.

Employee code of conduct The Company's code makes clear to employees the actions and behaviour expected of them when
representing the Company. The
Company strives to maintain the highest standards of employee conduct and ethical behaviour when operating abroad and
managing its supply chain.
Supplier code of conduct The Company’s main supplier is Toyota / Lexus. It has a contract in place to ensure that both parties
adhere to the highest standards of ethics. Where the Company deal with other suppliers such as small bodyshops or
repairers, they are required to demonstrate that they provide safe working conditions where necessary, treat workers with dignity and
respect, and act ethically and within the law in their use of labour. The Company will be introducing a supplier code of conduct,
serious violations of which would lead to the termination of the business relationship; however, the majority of these smaller suppliers
are sole traders.
Recruitment/Agency workers policy The Company uses specified Toyota approved, reputable employment agencies to source
labour. Alternatively, it
undertakes recruitment itself via word-of-mouth or the use of Recruitment Revolution which posts vacancies to a variety of websites
or various recruitment agencies; however, applications are sent directly to the Company. The risks of slavery and human trafficking
are therefore considered to be low in this area.
Due diligence
The Company regularly reviews its existing suppliers; it tends to use the same ones on a regular basis. The Company will undertake
due diligence when considering taking on new suppliers including:
evaluating the modern slavery and human trafficking risks of each new supplier (if applicable); this would be as part of a more
general human rights or labour rights assessment;
conducting supplier audits or assessments through the Company's own staff with a greater degree of focus on slavery and human
trafficking if general risks are identified; and
invoking sanctions against suppliers that fail to improve their performance in line with any action plan or supplier code of conduct
introduced by the Company including the termination of the business relationship.

As noted previously, the majority of the smaller suppliers used are sole traders and therefore the risk of modern slavery and human
trafficking is low.
Training
The Company requires all staff working with suppliers to complete training on modern slavery.
The modern slavery training covers:
how to assess the risk of slavery and human trafficking in relation to various aspects of the business, including resources and
support available;
how to identify the signs of slavery and human trafficking;
what initial steps should be taken if slavery or human trafficking is suspected;
how to escalate potential slavery or human trafficking issues to the relevant parties within the Company;
what external help is available, for example through the Modern Slavery Helpline, Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority and
""Stronger together"" initiative;
what messages, business incentives or guidance can be given to implement antislavery policies; and
what steps the Company should take if suppliers or contractors do not implement anti-slavery policies, including their removal
from the Company's supply chains.

Awareness-raising programme
As well as training staff, the Company raises awareness of modern slavery issues by distributing booklets to staff and putting up
posters across the Company's premises.
These booklets and posters explain to staff:
the basic principles of the Modern Slavery Act 2015;
how employers can identify and prevent slavery and human trafficking;

what employees can do to flag up potential slavery or human trafficking issues to the relevant parties within the Company; and
what external help is available, for example through the Modern Slavery Helpline.

Board approval
This statement was approved on 26 October 2020 by the Company's CEO and Owner, who will review and update it annually.

Ameon Limited is a medium sized company and is a leading force in the provision of mechanical, electrical and

the ﬁeld of preventative maintenance.
The following statement is made in pursuant to Section 54 Part 6 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, for the ﬁnancial year
ending 31st March 2019 and sets out the steps Ameon Limited has taken in the last 12 months to address the potential
for slavery and human traﬃcking taking place in our business or supply chain. It should be reading in conjunction with our
Purchasing Procedure and Whistle-blowing Policy.
Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. It takes various forms, such as slavery, servitude,
forced and compulsory labour and human traﬃcking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person’s liberty by
another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain. We have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery
and we are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships and to
implementing and enforcing eﬀective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our
own business or in any of our supply chains.
We are also committed to ensuring there is transparency in our own business and in our approach to tackling modern
slavery throughout our supply chains, consistent with our disclosure obligations under the Modern Slavery Act 2015. We
expect the same high standards from all of our subcontractors, suppliers and other business partners, and as part of our
contracting processes, we include speciﬁc prohibitions against the use of forced, compulsory or traﬃcked labour, or
anyone held in slavery or servitude, whether adults or children, and we expect that our suppliers will hold their own
suppliers to the same high standards.
This policy applies to all persons working for us or on our behalf in any capacity, including employees at all levels,
directors, oﬃcers, agency workers, seconded workers, volunteers, agents, subcontractors, external consultants, thirdparty representatives and business partners.
This policy dœs not form part of any employee’s contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.
Responsibility for the policy
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for ensuring this policy complies with our legal and ethical obligations,
and that all those under our control comply with it.
The Oﬃce & Finance Manager (OFM) has primary and day-to-day responsibility for implementing this policy, monitoring
its use and eﬀectiveness, dealing with any queries about it, and auditing internal control systems and procedures to
ensure they are eﬀective in countering modern slavery.
Management at all levels are responsible for ensuring those reporting to them understand and comply with this policy
and are given adequate and regular training on it and the issue of modern slavery in supply chains.
You are invited to comment on this policy and suggest ways in which it might be improved. Comments, suggestions and
queries are encouraged and should be addressed to the OFM.
Compliance with the policy
You must ensure that you read, understand and comply with this policy.
The prevention, detection and reporting of modern slavery in any part of our business or supply chains is the
responsibility of all those working for us or under our control. You are required to avoid any activity that might lead to, or
suggest, a breach of this policy.
You must notify your Line Manager or the OFM as soon as possible if you believe or suspect that a conﬂict with this
policy has occurred, or may occur in the future.
You are encouraged to raise concerns about any issue or suspicion of modern slavery in any parts of our business or
supply chains of any supplier tier at the earliest possible stage.

If you believe or suspect a breach of this policy has occurred or that it may occur you must notify your Line Manager /
OFM or report it in accordance with our Whistle-blowing Policy as soon as possible.
If you are unsure about whether a particular act, the treatment of workers more generally, or their working conditions
within any tier of our supply chains constitutes any of the various forms of modern slavery, raise it with your Line Manager
or the OFM.
We aim to encourage openness and will support anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith under this policy,
even if they turn out to be mistaken. We are committed to ensuring no one suﬀers any detrimental treatment as a result of
reporting in good faith their suspicion that modern slavery of whatever form is or may be taking place in any part of our
own business or in any of our supply chains. Detrimental treatment includes dismissal, disciplinary action, threats or other
unfavourable treatment connected with raising a concern. If you believe that you have suﬀered any such treatment, you
should inform the OFM immediately. If the matter is not remedied, and you are an employee, you should raise it formally
using our Grievance Procedure, which can be found in the Employee Handbook.
Communication and awareness of this policy
Training on this policy, and on the risk our business faces from modern slavery in its supply chains, forms part of the
induction process for all individuals who work for us, and regular training will be provided as necessary.
Our zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery must be communicated to all suppliers, subcontractors and business
partners at the outset of our business relationship with them and reinforced as appropriate thereafter.
Breaches of this policy
Any employee who breaches this policy will face disciplinary action, which could result in dismissal for misconduct or
gross misconduct.
We may terminate our relationship with other individuals and organisations working on our behalf if they breach this policy.
The company will review this policy on a regular basis and will introduce revisions as necessary.

Modern Slavery Statement
(First Statement)
Introduction

This Statement is made in accordance with Section 54, Part 6 of the Modern Slavery
Act 2015 (MSA).
The main purpose of Uneek Clothing Company Limited is to provide clothing
manufacturing and distribution services to customers in the UK and worldwide. Uneek
is committed to respect for human rights, in our own operations and in our supply chain.
Structure and Supply Chain
Uneek is a UK-based company with its Head Office in London. We have a Distribution
Centre in South Wales where all our products are received and dispatched worldwide.
All our European operations are headquartered in Germany.
Uneek’s products are produced in various countries, with dedicated facilities in China,
Pakistan and Bangladesh. We also have suppliers in Cambodia.
Uneek’s product are manufactured to our designs standards and then shipped directly
to our Distribution Centre through various carriers.
Policies on Modern Slavery
We are fully aware the prevalence of slavery and human trafficking, as well as other
human rights abuses, which occur in some of the countries we operate in. That is why,
before we work with any manufacturer or supplier, we make sure they adhere to the
International Labour Organisation Conventions on Slave labour, Forced Labour and
Human Trafficking. To ensure that these practices do not take place in any factory
supplying to us, we have put in place a mandatory reporting and monitoring system.
We carry out random and spot checks (unannounced) as well as pre-agreed checks
at the factories. Uneek pays and is committed to a Living Wage in the UK and pays
the highest possible rates to their overseas suppliers. We adhere to the ideal of Global
Human Rights Policy in that we recognise the right of all employees, whether in the
UK or overseas, to have a safe and respectful workplace. All Uneek employees,
manufacturers and suppliers are committed to complying with all applicable laws
regarding slavery and human trafficking whether in the UK or overseas countries where
we conduct our business.
Due Diligence Processes
Uneek is committed to and applies the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible
Business Conduct (as of 31st May 2018). That includes Due Diligence for Processes
for Slavery and Human Trafficking, and Due Diligence Guidelines for Responsible
Supply Chains. In order to combat the risk of slavery and human trafficking, we take

18/03/2019

steps to identifying those areas of our business where there is a risk of slavery and
human trafficking taking place. Therefore, Uneek consults key external informational
resources to identify where there could be a risk of slavery and human trafficking. We
will continue to monitor the situation and, where necessary, implement corrective
measures. Moreover, all employees (UK and Overseas) can contact the Director of
Personnel (or anyone else in senior management) directly and in strict confidence to
voice any concerns they might have about the treatment they or their colleague(s) are
receiving which might be less favourable; which might be an indication of slavery or
human trafficking.
Risk Assessment
We set out to identify the existence and the extent of any slavery and human trafficking
in our supply chains by conducting checks (including spot checks) at all factories that
supply us; interviewing workers without their managers or supervisors being present;
collaborating with the suppliers in putting in place measures to prevent slavery and
human trafficking. For example, we had heard that there were instances which could
have been construed as slavery and human trafficking in that some under age children
were being “employed” in one of our suppliers’ factory. We spoke to the supplier and
made a visit to the factory. It turned out that this was incorrect. Nevertheless, it was
explained to them that it was not an acceptable practice and, if at any time such
practice was discovered to be taking place then our relationship with them would be
terminated.
Measuring Effectiveness
Even though this is our first statement, we are putting in place verifiable KPIs to
measure progress which will be reported in the second and subsequent statements.
This is achievable through collaboration with the suppliers, visits, independent social
auditors and reports from NGOs.
Training Staff
Our commitment to identifying and eradicating any potential human rights breaches is
shared by all Uneek’s employees. We will continue to identify ways to improve
employee and supplier awareness of Uneek’s commitment to respect human rights
and efforts to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking. Training of staff by
external experts will be arranged in the coming months and years to make sure all our
staff and suppliers can identify and report any potential slavery or human trafficking.
This Statement has been approved by the Board of Uneek Clothing for submission.

MSD Animal Health Modern Slavery Act
Transparency Statement
For the financial year ending 31 December, 2019
This statement is made in relation to Section 54, Part 6 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and
sets out the steps that MSD Animal Health UK Limited has taken to ensure that modern slavery
and human trafficking is not taking place in our supply chains or in any part of our business.

Our Organisation
MSD Animal Health UK Limited is a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA, a
leading healthcare company that discovers, develops, manufactures and markets a wide range
of innovative pharmaceutical products to improve human health and animal health. Our
company is known as Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA in the United States and Canada.
Everywhere else we are known as MSD. To learn more about MSD Animal Health in the UK, visit
our company webpage.

Our Business

Our mission is the science of healthier animals. We are committed to providing the products,
technologies, services and insights to help meet the needs of veterinary surgeons, farmers and
pet owners. Our product categories include small animal, integrated livestock, ruminants,
poultry and equine. Through our animal health products including prescription medicines and
biologic therapies we work with customers and operate in more than 50 countries to deliver
innovative health solutions.

Our Values
As a company whose products aid the wellbeing of animals around the world, we hold ourselves
to a high standard. And we expect others to hold us to that same high standard.

Our Supply Chain
We purchase goods and services from thousands of suppliers around the world. Some of these
are external manufacturing companies that make key ingredients or components for our
products, manufacture finished products for us, package our products, and/or transport our
medicines.

Organisational Policies
MSD believes in the dignity of every human being and in respecting individual rights. Our
company has established global policies and processes to demonstrate this respect, including
our Human Rights Policy and our Code of Conduct (Our Values & Standards).
We strive to conduct business with individuals and organisations who share our commitment to
ethics and integrity and who operate in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. We
seek to obtain the goods and services we need in a way that is lawful, efficient and fair.
Our Business Partner Code of Conduct (BPCC) presents basic principles for our business
partners, including those that provide us with services, raw materials, active ingredients,
components, finished goods or other products. We use our BPCC to inform our business
partners of our expectation, among other things, that their workforce is treated with dignity
and respect and does not include any forced (or involuntary) labourers or child labourers.
The labour and human rights section of our BPCC states that business partners shall not (i) use
any form of forced or involuntary labour, including bonded labour, prison labour or indentured
labour; or (ii) engage in or support any form of slavery or human trafficking. It also includes
additional provisions on employment (recruitment) practices, employee disclosures (contracts)
and housing standards.
We communicate our BPCC to suppliers prior to the signing of any new or renewed contract or
agreement. Our BPCC is posted on our company’s webpage and is publicly available in 24
different languages, covering all countries in which MSD Animal Health currently operates.

Due Diligence

In 2015, we established a due diligence process to evaluate the labour and human rights risks
presented by our potential new i) direct material suppliers and ii) select indirect material
suppliers located in countries identified as high risk for labour and human rights.
As part of our due diligence, we use a questionnaire to gather information from suppliers on a
range of labour and human rights risk areas, including Freely Chosen Employment, Child
Labour, Young Workers, Fair Treatment, Wages & Benefits, Working Hours, Recruitment
Practices and Employee Disclosures.
The information gathered is used to determine the acceptability of suppliers’ local practices for
labour and human rights. The results of our due diligence activities are used by our
procurement professionals to inform our supplier selection and risk management processes.

Contracts
Before entering into a business relationship with a supplier, we ensure that appropriate
contracts are in place. Through our contracts, we endeavor to obtain a written commitment
from suppliers to respect and abide by the principles set forth in our BPCC, including those
related to labour and human rights. We expect all our business partners to firmly adhere to
these principles and operate in full compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.

Auditing
In 2015, we instituted a formal audit programme to evaluate supplier compliance with our
company’s standards for labour and human rights. The services of several third party audit
firms were engaged to perform independent labour and human rights audits at a number of our
direct material supplier’s facilities.
The facilities selected to receive an audit were located in countries identified as high risk for
labour and human rights. All were provided with advanced notification of our plan to audit their
facility. Audits were conducted over a 2-day period and comprised of interviews, a facility tour
and a review of relevant documentation. Since the start of the programme, a total of 234
supplier labour and human rights audits have been performed.
Our supplier audit programme for labour and human rights is still evolving. We intend to
perform additional audits during the course of 2020, focusing on direct material suppliers
whose facilities are located in countries identified by us as high risk for labour and human
rights.

Monitoring & Reporting
For suppliers that have received a labour and human rights audit, we established a process to
monitor and track the closure of the corrective actions being taken by them to address
identified instances of non-compliance revealed by our audits.
For each of these suppliers, we monitor and report on the status of their planned corrective
actions to members of our Third Party Risk Steering Committee. Suppliers that fail to address
identified instances of non-compliance in a responsible manner are brought to the attention of
this Committee.

Oversight
To further strengthen our oversight of the risks presented by third party business
relationships, we formed a new Third Party Risk Oversight Committee. Chaired by our Senior
Vice President (SVP) of Global Procurement, the role of this committee is to assist senior
leadership by providing independent and objective oversight, monitoring and reporting in
relation to the risks presented by third parties.

Training
Every MSD Animal Health employee is trained each year on the values and standards set forth
in our company’s Code of Conduct. All are provided with information on how to confidentially
and anonymously report concerns, using a variety of channels.
We provide training on our BPCC to all procurement employees that have responsibility for (1)
the selection of new suppliers and (2) managing MSD Animal Health’s existing base of
suppliers. Additional training on how to review, evaluate and mitigate concerns stemming from
our supplier due diligence activities is also provided to this same group. This training is designed
to help them identify, evaluate and mitigate potential risks associated with labour and human
rights in our supply chain.

Raising Concerns
We encourage the reporting of concerns and continue to maintain reporting channels to enable
our employees and our business partners to raise concerns, including any relating to improper
labour and employment practices or the unfair treatment of workers.
Any individual or organisation that knows or suspects that an MSD Animal Health’s business
partner or anyone acting on our behalf has engaged in activities that violate MSD Animal
Health’s BPCC is encouraged to visit msdethics.com to report the concern. Any individual that
reports a concern can remain anonymous if they choose. We investigate all reported concerns
to determine what action needs to be taken.

Accountability
At MSD Animal Health, all employees are responsible for adhering to the values and standards
set forth in our own Code of Conduct, complying with all relevant company polices and for
raising concerns if they are uncertain as to whether or not standards are being met. Violations
may result in a variety of corrective actions and in some cases may result in disciplinary action
up to and including termination of employment.
We hold our suppliers accountable for meeting their contractual obligations with MSD Animal
Health, including commitments that are made with respect to our BPCC and regulatory
compliance. Contract non-compliance can result in termination of MSD Animal Health’s
business relationship with the supplier and exclusion from any future business with our
company.

Introduction
This statement sets out Cabot Learning Federation’s (CLF) actions to understand all potential modern
slavery risks related to its business and to put in place steps that are aimed at ensuring that there is no
slavery or human trafﬁcking in its own business and its supply chains. This statement relates to actions
and activities during the ﬁnancial year 1 September 2019 to 31 August 2020.
The CLF, as part of the education sector, recognises its responsibility towards taking a robust approach to
slavery and human trafﬁcking.
The organisation is absolutely committed to preventing slavery and human trafﬁcking in its activities, and
to ensuring that its supply chains are free from slavery and human trafﬁcking.

Organisational structure and supply chains
The CLF is a growing Multi Academy Trust. It comprises of over 20 entities serving the educational needs
of circa 9,000 children and young people aged 3 to 19 and employing circa 1,700 colleagues.
In addition to CLF’s core activity of delivering education to our children and young people other business
activities include operating school centred initial teacher training, other training, school to school support
and income generation through lettings.
The CLF’s educational and business activities are delivered wholly within the UK and is predominately a
service based organisation. 75% of our turnover is spent on stafﬁng to deliver a high quality education to
our students. It procures goods and services from providers predominantly based within the UK.
Responsibility for the organisation’s anti-slavery initiatives is as follows:
Policies and Risk Assessments: The CLF’s Director for Education, Corporate Services Director,
Finance Director and HR Director are responsible for putting in place and reviewing policies and the
process by which they were developed. In addition, they are responsible for the broader organisational
responsibility for human rights and modern slavery risk
Investigations/due diligence: Principals and their leadership teams, Designated Safeguarding
Leads, the Corporate Services team, Finance team and HR team are responsible for investigations
and due diligence in relation to known or suspected instances of slavery and human trafﬁcking
relevant to their sphere of responsibility.
Training: The Director of CLF Institute is responsible for delivering training solutions that increase
awareness and a better understanding of and response to identiﬁed slavery and human trafﬁcking
Relevant policies: The organisation operates the following policies that describe its approach to the
identiﬁcation of modern slavery risks and steps to be taken to prevent slavery and human trafﬁcking in
its operations:
Recruitment, selection and disclosure policy and procedure The CLF solely employs
colleagues within the UK. Its recruitment practices are in accordance with Keeping Children Safe in
Education. All academies have 2 safeguarding audits carried out each year as follows:
An internal audit carried out by the academy and submitted to the Local Authority;
An audit carried out by the federation’s Designated Safeguarding
Whistleblowing policy The CLF encourages all its colleagues to disclose any activity which relates to
danger, bribery, corruption, fraud or other unlawful unethical conduct in the workplace. This includes
any circumstances that may give rise to an enhanced risk of slavery or human trafﬁcking. The
organisation’s whistleblowing procedure is designed to make it easy for workers to make disclosures,
without fear of retaliation.
Employee code of conduct The CLF’s code makes clear to employees the actions and behaviour
expected of them when representing the organisation. The CLF strives to maintain the highest
standards of employee conduct and ethical
Anti-bribery and corruption policy The CLF is committed to implementing effective measures to
conduct its business activities in an honest and ethical

Financial Regulations The CLF is committed to delivering a responsible procurement policy that
ensures its suppliers adhere to the modern slavery act. Any breach of the act will lead to the
termination of the contract.
Recruitment Agencies The organisation uses only speciﬁed, reputable employment agencies to
source labour.

Procurement, Due Diligence and Supply Chain Management
The CLF is committed to ensuring its suppliers adhere to the highest standards of ethics. The larger value
contracts are procured either through a purchasing framework or appointed through means of a tender
process. Our supply chain includes a range of goods and services with the majority purchased within the
UK.
We have identiﬁed that some of our procurement takes place in sectors where modern slavery offences
could occur. We will be taking the following steps to promote awareness during 2019:
Update our New Supplier form to request all suppliers must sign and conﬁrm adhere to the Modern
Slavery Act. Then evaluate the modern slavery and human trafﬁcking risk of each supplier.
Updating our ﬁnancial regulations and procurement practices to ensure greater scrutiny around
compliance at the procurement stage; including compliance with the Modern Slavery Act as a
condition or criterion in speciﬁcation and tender documents wherever
Conduct a more in-depth review of our supply chains to better understand the risks of modern slavery
occurring within

Performance indicators
The CLF has reviewed its key performance indicators (KPIs). As a result, the CLF is:
requiring all CLF Academy leaders, Operations Managers, Finance professionals, Corporate Services
Professionals and HR Professionals to have completed training on modern slavery by 31 August 2019;
developing a system for supply chain veriﬁcation expected to be in place by 31 August 2019, whereby
the CLF evaluates potential suppliers before they enter the supply chain; and
reviewing its existing supply chains expected to be completed by 31 August 2019 whereby the
organisation evaluates all existing

Training
The CLF requires all CLF Academy leaders, Operations Managers, Designated Safeguarding Leads,
Finance professionals, Corporate Services Professionals and HR professionals to complete training on
modern slavery.
The organisation’s modern slavery training covers:
CLF’s purchasing practices, which inﬂuence supply chain conditions and which should therefore be
designed to prevent purchases at unrealistically low prices, the use of labour engaged on
unrealistically low wages or wages below a country’s national minimum wage, or the provision of
products by an unrealistic deadline;
how to assess the risk of slavery and human trafﬁcking in relation to various aspects of the business,
including resources and support available;
how to identify the signs of slavery and human trafﬁcking;
what initial steps should be taken if slavery or human trafﬁcking is suspected;
how to escalate potential slavery or human trafﬁcking issues to the relevant parties within the
organisation;
what external help is available, for example through the Modern Slavery Helpline, Gangmasters and
Labour Abuse Authority and “Stronger together” initiative;
what messages, business incentives or guidance can be given to suppliers and other business
partners and contractors to implement anti-slavery policies; and
what steps the organisation should take if suppliers or contractors do not implement anti-slavery
policies in high-risk scenarios, including their removal from the organisation’s supply chains. our
purchasing practices, which inﬂuence supply chain conditions and which should therefore be designed
to prevent purchases at unrealistically low prices, the use of labour engaged on unrealistically low

wages or wages below a country’s national minimum wage, or the provision of products by an
unrealistic deadline;

Awareness-raising programme
As well as training staff, the organisation has raised awareness of modern slavery issues by putting up
posters across the organisation’s premises.
The posters explain to staff:
the basic principles of the Modern Slavery Act 2015;
how the CLF can identify and prevent slavery and human trafﬁcking;
what employees can do to ﬂag up potential slavery or human trafﬁcking issues to the relevant parties
within the organisation; and
what external help is available, for example through the Modern Slavery

Modern Slavery
Statement

Marex Slavery and human trafficking
statement
This statement is made by Marex Spectron Group Limited on behalf of
itself and its affiliates (collectively “Marex”), pursuant to section 54 of
the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”) for the financial year ending 31
December 2019. The statement sets out the steps that we have taken
to minimise the risk of modern slavery existing in our business or supply
chains.
Marex is a leading global commodities brokerage headquartered in
London, with offices in Europe, Asia and North America.

Our values and policies
As a global enterprise, we are rightly held to high standards in all that we do. Marex recognises its
corporate responsibility and is committed to maintaining a culture within which ethical behaviour is
promoted. Marex supports the Act’s objectives to eradicate modern slavery, which it defines as
“slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour” as well as “human trafficking”.
While Marex recognises that our suppliers operate within different legal and cultural environments,
our Supplier Code of Conduct outlines the basic ethical requirements that our suppliers must
adhere to in order to do business with us, including our zero tolerance approach to modern slavery,
namely:
Prohibition of slavery and forced labour: we condemn the abhorrent practices of slavery, forced
and compulsory labour, servitude and human trafficking. Be it through coercion, intimidation, verbal
or physical threats of violence to the individual or their family, bondage or any other means that
violates that individual’s liberty.
Prohibition of child labour: we are committed to ensuring all employees meet the minimum age for
employment in the relevant country.
Remuneration: this must meet the minimum legal requirements of the relevant country in which the
individual works.
Working conditions: reasonable health and safety measures are taken in maintaining a safe and
hygienic working environment.
We reserve the right to terminate a supplier’s contract at any time should instances of modern
slavery come to light.

Risk Assesment
In light of the regulatory landscape in which Marex operates, we believe we continue to be at a low
risk of modern slavery and human trafficking existing within our business. Nonetheless, we have
implemented an internal modern slavery policy in our Staff Handbook that sets out our zero
tolerance approach to modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chains.
The policy also provides details to employees on how to report any suspicions pertaining to
modern slavery. Further, as per our whistleblowing policy, we actively support employees in raising
concerns if they believe that anything illegal or unethical (including, but not limited to a breach of
our policies) is taking place.
We consider there to be a greater risk of modern slavery and human trafficking occurring within
our supply chains and have enhanced our due diligence procedures for suppliers during the onboarding process. We have also developed contractual representations prohibiting modern slavery
and human trafficking that we require all suppliers to include in their contracts with us. These sit
alongside existing ethical clauses like the prohibition of bribery. This is in addition to our Supplier
Code of Conduct.

Training and Awareness
To ensure suitable understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking occurring in
our supply chains, and where we deem there is a high risk of modern slavery or human trafficking
within our supply chain or internally, we will organise externally sourced training for those relevant
employees.
This statement has been approved by Marex’s board of directors.

2018 Modern Slavery Statement - Leyland Trucks Ltd
Structure and Supply Chains
Leyland Trucks Ltd, part of PACCAR Inc's global group of businesses, is one of Britain’s leading manufacturing companies as PACCAR’s established centre for light and medium duty truck design,
development and manufacturing. The company, employing over 850 people, manufactures the full range of DAF product, of which approximately 50% is exported to all European Union markets and
the wider world.
In 2018 Leyland Trucks shipped over £750m of parts and materials into the UK from its global supply base. Over 99% was shipped from within the EU.
Modern Slavery disclosures and procedures are the responsibility of the senior leadership team. Leyland Trucks works closely with its supply chain to ensure compliance with laws and regulations;
modern slavery forms part of these requirements. Leyland Trucks plans to continually improve in the area of monitoring for and managing risks of modern slavery.
Policies on Modern Slavery
Leyland Trucks, along with the global PACCAR organisation, is committed to ensuring that its suppliers do not use slave labour or engage in human trafficking. PACCAR’s Supplier Code of Conduct
prohibits suppliers from using forced labour of any kind. PACCAR’s Supplier Code of Conduct can be found at:
https://www.paccar.com/about-us/environmental-social-and-governance-esg/social/supplier-code-of-conduct/
PACCAR has a Code of Business Conduct (“Code”) requiring officers and employees to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Employees receive training on the Code, which is
published on the company’s intranet. Any employee determined to have violated the Code will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination in accordance with local law.
Leyland Trucks recruitment and equal opportunities policy acknowledges our recruitment processes are compliant with the Modern Slavery Act and our recruitment processes include eligibility to
work checks. Our policies and procedures are subject to continuous and ongoing annual review.

Due Diligence Processes, Risk Assessment and Measuring Effectiveness
Our recruitment processes are transparent. Communication to discuss job opportunities and to confirm the details of any offer made takes place directly with candidates. There are robust
procedures in place for the vetting of new employees and agency staff that enable us to confirm their identities and that ensure they are paid directly. Leyland Trucks expects all contracted business
partners in the supply chain to uphold high standards of conduct. Leyland Trucks clearly communicates its expectations; obligations for business partners include the ethical behaviour clauses that
form an important part of our contracts. On every appropriate occasion and every time the business relationship is up for renewal these items are part of the dialogue.
We are developing a more comprehensive due diligence process to be utilised as part of our regular supplier quality assessments to identify the risk of modern slavery. We will also review Modern
Slavery Statements of key suppliers who are required to publish such statements and seek further information as necessary from these suppliers. Senior management will assess the effectiveness of
our efforts to identify and reduce the risk of any modern slavery in our supply chain.
Leyland Trucks regards suppliers in countries rated as Tier 3 risk, per US State Dept 2018 Annual TIP Report, as those at highest risk from modern slavery. There are 10 suppliers we know that
directly manufacture in these countries or have supply chains extending to these countries and these suppliers are prioritised for 2019 review.
Leyland Trucks makes use of supplier quality audit tools and will explore options for incorporating Modern Slavery reviews into the ongoing use of these business tools.
Training for staff
The senior management team at Leyland Trucks are briefed on the requirements of the UK Modern Slavery Act. The PACCAR group’s training curriculum for Purchasing and Supplier Quality
personnel includes awareness training regarding prevention of slave labour and human trafficking.
Leyland Trucks, being part of the PACCAR group, periodically reviews the content of its compliance training programme and is developing risk-based modern slavery awareness content for the
training programme.
Employees are encouraged to report any potential incidents or grievances to their manager, Compliance Officer or to the PACCAR Ethics Hotline. Details are published on the company’s intranet.

Modern slavery is a crime and a gross violation of fundamental human rights. It takes
various forms, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person’s liberty by
another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain.
We have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and are fully committed to
preventing slavery and human trafficking within all of our business activities.
Pursuant to s54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, Finnebrogue offers the following
statement regarding its efforts to prevent slavery and human trafficking both within
our business, and within its supply chain, for the financial year ended 31st August
2018.
Our Business
Finnebrogue is a food company with over 400 employees, specialising in the
production of quality sausage, burger and stuffing products. We’ve built our business
on crafting artisan food that makes a difference, from the welfare of the animals;
stewardship of the land to the way we treat our colleagues. Our dedication to
excellence, craftsmanship and passion for great food is the driving force behind
everything we do; and our integrated business model adopts the principles of quality,
integrity and customer satisfaction.
Our Policies on Slavery and Human Trafficking
Finnebrogue respects and acknowledges internationally recognised human rights
principles. Within our company and throughout our supply chain, we are committed to
treating people with dignity and respect. Finnebrogue internal policies include our
Human Rights policy and our Ethical Trade Policy which reflects our commitment to
acting ethically and with integrity in all of our business relationships. We confirm
that we will not tolerate any abuse of human rights within any part of our business or
supply chains and will take seriously any allegations that human rights are not properly
respected or protected.
Our Supply Chain
We work within a large, diverse value chain of business partners and stakeholders.
There are often two to five levels of suppliers between us as an end user and the
source of raw materials that enter the manufacturing process. We recognise that each
entity in this chain has its own independent duty to respect human rights. We expect
our business partners and stakeholders to adhere to ethical business conduct
consistent with our own, and are committed to working with them to fulfill this
common goal
What have we done?
• We have embraced the Stronger Together Programme within our business, and
support the work being done to reduce forced labour and human trafficking in
the UK. Our HR Team have been externally trained in the exploitation of
human labour. All employees have received training in the Stronger Together
principles and their rights at work. We provide mechanisms to our employees
to raise issues and concerns, via the Employee Voice, our open door policy, and
our confidential Whistleblowing hotline.

•

After acknowledging the risk that agency labour creates in relation to human
trafficking, we have removed agency labour from our business at an
operational level.

•

As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk we monitor ethical
standards across the business on a regular basis both internally and via external
third party audits. We undergo unannounced SEDEX members Ethical Trade
Audits, customer ethical trade audits, and these are supported by our own
internal Ethical verification audits.

•

The business is an AB member of SEDEX and our suppliers register with SEDEX
and make their Ethical data visible to us, enabling us to drive Ethical standards
within our supply chain. At August 2018, we currently have over 60 suppliers
linked to us on SEDEX. Where suppliers are not currently linked to Finnebrogue
on SEDEX or registered on SEDEX, then they are required to complete our
Ethical Questionnaire (based on the ETI Base Code) until they are registered.

•

We have operated a risk-based approach in the steps we have taken that seek
to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any of our
supply chains or in any part of our business. Through the use of a broad
enterprise-wide slavery and human trafficking risk assessment we seek to focus
our relevant policies, standards, practices and programmes on those parts of
our supply chain and our business - and upon those geographies - where we
believe greatest risk of slavery and human trafficking lies. Our initial focus has
been on primary supply.

What will we do next?
Finnebrogue will maintain the current controls in place over the next twelve month
period. Additional activities will include:
•

An increased focus within the supply chain beyond a primary level, with
completion of risk assessments (and associated corrective actions) at a
secondary and tertiary level.

•

The implementation of a Human Rights Strategy within our Business

This Statement was approved by the Board of Directors of Finnebrogue on 31 August
2018.

Modern Slavery
Statement
Home / Modern Slavery Statement

Introduction
This statement is made on behalf of
4imprint Group plc (“4imprint”)
pursuant to section 54 of the Modern
Slavery Act 2015 and comprises our
slavery and human trafficking
statement in respect of the financial
year ending 2 January 2021.

Our Business
4imprint is the leading direct
marketer of promotional
merchandise in North America, the
UK and Ireland. We supply custom
imprinted products that are used
with the aim of promoting an
organisation, brand, product or
event.
Our product range is comprised of
around 60% hard goods, for example
drinkware, writing instruments,
stationery, office products and tech
accessories, and 40% soft goods,
including apparel, bags, towels and
blankets.
Currently, 4imprint has around 1,150
permanent staff, 1,100 of whom are
based in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, in the
USA. The remainder are located in

either Manchester or London in the
UK. In addition, temporary workers
are used, to a seasonal peak of
around 100.
Our staff, whether directly employed
by a 4imprint Group entity or
engaged through a long-term
temporary agency partner, are not in
any category that is generally seen to
be vulnerable to modern slavery in
the UK or in the USA. Our focus with
regard to slavery and human
trafficking is, therefore, primarily
directed towards our supply chain.

Our Supply Chain
We are acutely aware that our supply
chain is long and often complex,
extending far beyond our domestic
supply base.
4imprint outsources all product
manufacturing and most product
decoration/imprinting. Our tier 1
suppliers are predominantly
domestic, (USA, Canada, UK, EU).
These suppliers typically take care of
overseeing the manufacture,
importing, inventory management
and imprinting of the product with
our customer’s logo, name or
message, enabling 4imprint to ship
thousands of individually customised
orders on a daily basis.
Our domestic tier 1 suppliers, in turn,
purchase most of their blank
inventory from tier 2 manufacturers
of the base product who may be
located around the globe. China and
the USA represent the dominant
countries of tier 2 manufacture,
together accounting for around 75%
of our products. Products may also
originate in Central America, South
and East Asia, and a small amount
from African markets.

Further down the supply chain are
tier 3 suppliers who are generally raw
material suppliers, component
manufacturers or process specialists,
e.g. dye houses.

Our Policies on Slavery
and Human Trafficking
Generally, our Social and Ethical
Policy Statement reflects our overriding commitment to acting ethically
and with integrity in all of our
business relationships.
Specifically, our aim is to guard
against the occurrence of modern
slavery or human trafficking in any
part of our business or at any level in
our supply chain through the
communication of our expectations,
the implementation of appropriate
procedures and the other actions
that we take.
Furthermore, our Whistleblowing
Policy acts in tandem with our
policies on slavery and human
trafficking by encouraging staff to
report concerns including any
situations related to modern slavery,
human trafficking and child or forced
labour.
Despite our best intentions and the
steps that we take, a possibility
remains that without our knowledge
and consent certain factors may
compromise our ability to mitigate
against the risk of slavery or human
trafficking occurring at some level in
our supply chain. When any such
circumstances come to our attention,
we will take prompt and decisive
action with a view to remediating the
situation as a first preference, whilst
ultimately being prepared to
terminate the offending supply
relationship if necessary.

What are we doing?
It is our view that the risks of modern
slavery, human trafficking and
related social issues increase the
further that we go back in our supply
chain. This view is based on the US
State Department’s Trafficking in
Persons assessments and is backed
up by our extensive supply chain
experiences over the last decade and
more.
We have implemented a Supply
Chain Code of Conduct to address
the risk of modern slavery, human
trafficking and broader corporate
and social responsibility
perspectives. This Code of Conduct is
in line with International Labour
Organisation principles and the Fair
Labor Association’s Code of Conduct.
The signature of our tier 1 suppliers
to this document affirms their
acceptance.
Compliance is reviewed and verified
through site visits/inspections by
4imprint’s merchandising and vendor
compliance specialists. These visits
extend to tier 1 suppliers’ domestic
facilities, as well as the operations of
their overseas (tier 2) manufacturers.
A high level of trust and transparency
is essential for our suppliers to allow
us access into their supply chains.
While the impact of COVID-19
presented challenges in executing
audits in 2020, we have managed to
carry out audits in certain parts of
the world where some travel has
been possible, such as China. In
addition, we have trialled virtual
audits in the US domestic market.
Independent third-party audits
continue to include worker
interviews, review of recruitment

processes, grievance mechanisms
and other common potential
indicators of modern slavery. Audit
failures or material issues are
addressed as a matter of priority.

Awareness
We concentrate our awareness
initiatives on those members of staff
who are involved with the supply of
products. Awareness of modern
slavery, human trafficking and
related issues tends to be
communicated to appropriate supply
chain team members by senior
merchandising and vendor
relations/compliance managers who
are active in visiting and assessing
our tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers and
managing our programme.
We anticipate that our awareness
and training programme regarding
modern slavery and human
trafficking will continue to be refined
and expanded in 2021 and beyond.

Responsibility
Responsibility for overseeing and
implementing of the contents of this
Statement rests with the Senior Vice
President – Merchandising and
Supply Chain (suppliers and supply
chain), the Senior Vice President –
Administration (4imprint internal
operations), and ultimately the Chief
Executive Officer.

Approval
This statement has been formally
approved by the Directors of
4imprint.

SUPPLY CHAINS ACT OF 2010 (SB 657)
SPECIALIZED DISCLOSURE
""Human trafﬁcking affects us all, whether we live in countries of origin, transit or destination.
Preventing and combating it requires a comprehensive international approach. We must act
together to stop a crime in our midst that deprives countless victims of their liberty, dignity and
human rights.""
— Ms. Asha-Rose Migiro Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations

Specialized is committed to upholding human and labor rights, ensuring that every worker has safe and fair
working conditions and that there is 'zero tolerance' for human trafﬁcking and slavery in our supply chain. The
policies, procedures and operations outlined in our Sustainable Innovation Program incorporates explicit
prohibition of human trafﬁcking and slavery and addresses issues of human trafﬁcking and slavery required
under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, as well as addressing other issues of social and
environmental sustainability. Standards for workplace conditions for our supply chain partners are outlined in our
Code of Conduct and the code element Forced Labor speciﬁcally calls out our commitment to prohibiting
human trafﬁcking and slavery anywhere in our direct and indirect supply chain.

Below is our disclosure statement pursuant to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657).

The disclosure described in subdivision (a) shall, at a minimum, disclose to what extent, if any, the retail seller or
manufacturer does each of the following:

1. Veriﬁcation of supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafﬁcking and slavery.
Specialized is a founding member of the WFSGI Bicycle Industry Labor group, which is currently piloting
labor standards, auditing protocol and the creation of a shared database of audit results via the Fair Factories
Clearinghouse (FFC). Our Code of Conduct is based on the International Labour Organization (ILO) code
and states that any form of forced labor, which includes human trafﬁcking, slavery and child labor are
prohibited in our supply chain.

2. Audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with Specialized's standards for trafﬁcking and
slavery in supply chains.
Specialized has created both Code of Conduct and Zero Tolerance policies for labor practices and
implemented a process for consistent and ongoing auditing of it’s supply chain to ensure compliance with
those policies. Proposed new suppliers must undergo auditing and evaluation of their facilities and labor
practices before they may be considered to become a formal supplier. Evaluation of those audits is
conducted by a senior leadership team, which includes environmental and social responsibility leadership.
Proposed suppliers unable to meet our standards will not be considered to participate in our supply chain.
This system ensures that we do not contract with new suppliers engaging in substandard human rights
practices. Auditing suppliers with regard to sustainable manufacturing, speciﬁcally slavery and human
trafﬁcking, is a high priority for Specialized. Audits are conducted through a combination of internal staff,
contract labor consultants and third party auditing ﬁrms.

3. Certiﬁcation by suppliers that materials comply with slavery and human trafﬁcking laws of the country
where they are doing business.
A key focus of our communication strategy with our suppliers is in building a clear understanding of the risks
of non-compliance with our code of conduct, especially around the topics of human trafﬁcking and slavery.
Our goal is to build capacity with our suppliers so that they may certify their own suppliers and verify the
eradication of human trafﬁcking and slavery further up complex supply webs. Suppliers are required to
acknowledge their understanding of our Code of Conduct by formerly signing a document conﬁrming the
factory’s adherence to it’s requirements. In addition, we regularly evaluate a factory’s practices of managing
for eradication of human rights and slavery and include that evaluation in our supplier scorecards.

4. Procedures for failures to meet Specialized's standards regarding slavery and human trafﬁcking.
Specialized has developed internal policies & procedures that incorporate disciplinary actions appropriate to
the issue at hand with separate tracks for the evaluation of new suppliers and the evaluation of existing
suppliers. The focus is on remediation and executing swift solutions for the protection of human rights as well
as excluding new suppliers from our supply chain who fail to meet our Code of Conduct and Zero Tolerance
Policy. Our Zero Tolerance policy outlines a swift and binding course of action, requiring immediate factory
response and remediation of the identiﬁed issue by the factory in question. Issues Specialized strictly
prohibits, condemns and has zero tolerance for must be given the highest level of attention and immediate
resolution or Specialized reserves the right to cease business with that supplier.

5. Training on human trafﬁcking and slavery, including mitigating risks within the supply chain.
Specialized has an ongoing internal training program for employees to understand the issues relating to
social and environmental responsibility with a focus on human trafﬁcking and slavery in manufacturing. This
training is also extended to suppliers with a long-term partnership approach to remediating issues in conﬂict
with our Code of Conduct in the supply chain. We understand that accountability is key to an authentic
commitment to sustainable manufacturing. Specialized's corporate policy for sustainable manufacturing has
been communicated throughout the company, it’s supply chain and informs the ongoing work being carried
out in product creation.

Tenet Group Ltd and Subsidiaries (“Tenet”) Slavery and Human
Trafﬁcking Statement for the Financial Year ending 30
September 2016
This statement is made pursuant to s.54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out the steps
that we have taken, and are continuing to take, to ensure that modern slavery or human
trafﬁcking is not taking place within our business or supply chain.
Modern Slavery encompasses slavery, servitude, human trafﬁcking and forced labour. We have a
zero tolerance approach to any form of modern slavery. We are committed to acting ethically and
with integrity and transparency in all business dealings, and to putting effective systems and
controls in place to safeguard against any form of modern slavery taking place within the
business or our supply chain.

Our Business
Tenet is a UK based company which operates a Financial Services Network through its
subsidiary companies, TenetConnect Limited, TenetConnect Services Limited and TenetLime
Limited, all of which are authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.
We authorise individuals and corporate bodies to act as our Appointed Representatives in
accordance with the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
We are a service business within the ﬁnancial services sector, providing amongst other things
compliance and back ofﬁce support to our Appointed Representatives, who are authorised by us
to provide ﬁnancial advice and recommend ﬁnancial products to retail customers within the
United Kingdom.

Our Supply Chains
Our supply chains include suppliers of IT, telephone and ofﬁce equipment, hotel conference
facilities, insurance brokerage, professional services from our lawyers, accountants and other
advisers.
Our suppliers are predominantly from the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States of
America. We have determined that we are in a low risk industry as are the vast majority of our
suppliers; therefore we do not consider the risk of modern slavery within our supply chain to be a
signiﬁcant risk.

Due Diligence Processes for Modern Slavery and Human
Trafﬁcking
We shall use our reasonable endeavours to ensure that slavery or human trafﬁcking is not taking
place in our supply chains by reviewing all relevant current and future suppliers to ensure that
they comply with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
Through our procurement process we will seek assurance from all relevant suppliers about their
anti-slavery and human trafﬁcking policies, and whether they are taking steps to prevent slavery
and human trafﬁcking in their respective business and supply chains; this action will be
undertaken by reviewing their Modern Slavery Act 2015 statements. We will not support or
engage suppliers where we are aware of slavery or human trafﬁcking in such suppliers’ business
or supply chains or where a supplier has failed to give us the requisite assurances.

Policy and Training
In 2017 we will be implementing an Anti-Slavery and Human Trafﬁcking Policy which will
apply to all persons working for or with any Tenet company, including but not limited to those in
the capacity of employee, contractor, agency worker, temporary staff, agents, external
consultants and suppliers.
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafﬁcking in
our business and supply chains, we will be providing training to all relevant staff involved in the
procurement of goods or services so they understand the signs of modern slavery and what to do
if they suspect that it is taking place within our supply chain.

Our Working Practices
We allow all individuals who work or provide services to us the right to freely choose
employment and the right to associate freely with other individuals. We offer an environment
which is free from harassment and unlawful discrimination.
We ensure that our working practices are in accordance with the Equality Act 2010 and all
employment legislation. We do not engage in forced or involuntary labour and have a zero
tolerance approach to the same, meaning we do not tolerate any of our suppliers engaging in
such conduct.
This statement is made under section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes
Tenet’s slavery and human trafﬁcking statement for the ﬁnancial year ending 30th September
2016.
This statement has been approved by Tenet's Board of Directors and will be reviewed annually.

Vaillant Group Modern Slavery Statement 2020
1. Statement
The UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 came into effect on 29th October 2015. The law requires manufacturers
and retailers doing business in the UK which supply goods or services and have an annual turnover
exceeding £36 million to disclose information regarding their policies to eradicate slavery and human
trafficking from their supply chain and within their business.
The Vaillant Group understands that slavery, servitude, forced labour and human trafficking (Modern
Slavery) is a global and growing issue given the rapid rise in global migration, existing in every region in
the world and in every type of economy, whether industrialised, developing or in transition.
The Vaillant Group is very proud of the integrity measures we take in this regard. The Vaillant Group
efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in its supply chain and own business include the

The Vaillant Group manufactures products in a total of ten locations – eight of these are in Europe, one in
Turkey and one in China. Production includes the manufacturing of all performance- and quality-relevant
key components as well as the final assembly of all devices, plus comprehensive testing of the
performance attributes.

1.3. Our risk assessment
Vaillant Group’s Integrated Risk and Opportunity Management (Integriertes Risiko- und
Chancenmanagement (RCMS)) is an early warning system that closely monitors potential risks and
opportunities. The holistic approach combines financial, regulatory, physical and reputational risks and is
part of our regular internal management reporting system.
To adequately address the concerns of our business partners, customers and the general public we
systematically conduct stakeholder dialogues. These guide us in pro-actively identifying potential needs
for information or action. In addition, we carry out a risk assessment regarding potential human rights
violations on a regular basis. This risk assessment focuses on the identification of concerned interest
groups as well as the probability of human rights being violated, the severity of potential human rights
abuses and the possibility of the Vaillant Group having a counteractive or preventive influence.
Furthermore, we evaluate the countries in which we source our goods with an eye to potential risks
according to the Worldwide Governance Indicators of the World Bank. The World bank reports on
individual and aggregate governance indicators for over 200 countries and territories for six dimensions of
governance: voice and accountability; political stability and absence of violence; government
effectiveness; regulatory quality; rule of law; and control of corruption.

1.4. Our CR Strategy
The Vaillant Group has combined all its sustainability activities into one strategic programme. Under the
name S.E.E.D.S., binding, quantifiable targets have been set in the following fields of focus: Environment,
Employees, Development & Products and Society. We develop specific measures based on these targets
and continuously monitor the results. Transparently and group-wide. We manage our sustainability
performance using an established approach: the classic control circle applied to corporate management
systems.
On the basis of the sustainability strategy, binding and verifiable targets are set for all four fields of focus
in the S.E.E.D.S. programme. For example supporting SOS Children’s Villages worldwide. In order to
meet these targets we then implement operational measures in all relevant areas of the company. In
order to test how effective these measures are, key performance indicators (KPIs) and a target figure are
established for our targets. Every quarter, we survey all relevant data on a group-wide basis to calculate
the individual KPIs. These are brought together in a central control tool, the Vaillant Group Sustainability
Scorecard. By comparing figures from the same period in the previous year against the long-term targets
during the annual review, we are able to gain an accurate picture of the current state of our sustainability
performance.

1.5. Our Supply Chains
The human rights policy statement is an important part of our social responsibility. The policy statement
provides details on the observance of human rights, specifying
● the international standards and guidelines we use as guidance,
● the issues and areas of activity that are particularly relevant to us, e.g. rejecting all forms of degrading
treatment, slavery, torture, child labour or discrimination, while respecting the right of every individual
to life, liberty and (social) security,
● which measures we have implemented to ensure the observance of human rights, for example in
relation to our suppliers,
● responsibilities at the management level,
● the opportunity for everyone to flag up grievances through a whistle-blowing system.

1.6. Our Supply Chains
Our suppliers from various countries help us providing the quality our customers and business partners
expect. We source a wide range of products and services from across the globe from small family-run
business to large multinationals, all with their own supply chains. As we expect our suppliers to meet our
high standards, we are in constant exchange with them and seek for common understanding and united
action.

1.7. Our Measures taken to address modern slavery
A robust governance, clear policies, an effective risk assessment as well as a profound understanding of
our supply chain are basis for a targeted approach to addressing slavery and human trafficking. At Vaillant
Group we incorporate mechanisms to preventing modern slavery at various stages: when selecting a
supplier, when engaging with suppliers, when assessing them and when aiming for further development.

1.7.1. Selection process
For new suppliers we have integrated social and environmental aspects in our supplier pre-assessment. It
includes:
• A commitment to the United Nations Global Compact
• Compliance with Minimum Wage legislation
This helps us to carefully select suppliers supporting the values Vaillant Group stands for. Furthermore it
is expected that the supplier ensures compliance with the same diligence and regulations under which he
operates for the Vaillant Group from all its sub-suppliers.
1.7.2. Key suppliers
Because of their degree of integration, the nature of their products and services or volume certain
business partners play a key role in our company’s success. We are closely engaged with these key
suppliers to reassure their commitment to the principles of the UNGC.
As a result, we have introduced our Supplier Quality Guideline in 2012 (updated in 2016) covering not
only product and process related quality aspects but also environmental and social concerns, such as UN
Global Compact.
1.7.3. Supplier Audits

1.7.3. Supplier Audits
All new suppliers are subject to a risk-oriented supplier audit covering quality, compliance, environmental
and social concerns. In addition, we conduct audits of existing suppliers on a regular basis.
We developed a standardized questionnaire used in the supplier audits which includes sections on human
rights and labour standards, occupational health, environmental protection and the fight against
corruption.
The audit touches “labour and ethics” issues including
● Forced labour
● Child labour
● Discrimination based on race, colour, age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, disability, pregnancy,
religion, political affiliation, union membership or marital status
● Freedom of association
● Health and safety
● Corruption and bribery
● Protection of intellectual property
In case necessary, corrective action plans are agreed on which will be subject to review during the next
audit at the latest. In addition, in case of a violation of the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact, the
auditor is entitled to conclude the audit result as “not capable”. Depending on the seriousness of the
violation the supplier might be blocked.
In 2019 we have completed roughly 234 supplier audits. Our continuous efforts ensure that within the last
4 years we have covered around 911 suppliers.
1.7.4. Training
To keep awareness high and ensure that measures preventing modern slavery are part of day-to-day
business we have included respective aspects in our development efforts for suppliers and auditors.
• Auditors receive initial training on the United Nations Global Compact, incl. how to address this during
the on-site visit.
• In 2019 our auditors received a comprehensive training by a renowned external training organization on
the United Nations Global Compact and how to conduct social audits.
• Suppliers are supported by our Supplier Quality Guideline and are invited to seek for support in case
needed.

1.8. Whistleblower system
The Vaillant Group has implemented a whistleblower system. Employees and third parties such as
customers or suppliers can use the system to flag up grievances or report violations of laws or internal
regulations without any risks being posed to the person submitting the report. Reports can also be
submitted on an anonymous basis.

1.9. Evaluation of the effectiveness of our measures
As part of our structured approach, we review the measures taken and – in case it is necessary – redirect
our efforts. At Vaillant Group we rely on
• Expert judgment (e.g. from our agents, regional experts)
• Stakeholder dialogue (e.g. with industry associations)
• Benchmark (e.g. to adopt best practice)

1.10. Forward Looking Statement
The Vaillant Group has taken various effective measures to address modern slavery and human
trafficking. In an attitude of continuous improvement, we remain committed to further strengthen our
efforts in the upcoming years. We are determined to even better understand our suppliers’ activities to
combat modern slavery. We will provide an update on our activities in future statements.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our
slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 2019.

Human Trafﬁcking Policy

March 2021
INTRODUCTION:
This policy has been agreed by the Directors of Barker Ross Group Limited, and
applies across all operations of the Group activity. This includes Barker Ross
Stafﬁng Solutions Limited, Barker Ross Recruitment Limited and Cardea
Resourcing Limited, T/A Barker Ross Health and Social Care.
This policy is reviewed and published annually, each January, following our
company year end, which is the preceding November. We share this policy to all
employees and it is also shared via our website: www.barkerross.co.uk and can also
be found at TISCreport.org and modernslaveryregistry.org.
Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. It takes
various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human
trafﬁcking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person's liberty by
another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain.
Barker Ross Group have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and we are
committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and
relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to
ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our own business or in any of
our supply chains. As a labour only supplier, our supply chains are minimal and
limited to other services (utilities, IT provision) and stationery.
We are also committed to ensuring there is transparency in our own business and in
our approach to tackling modern slavery throughout our supply chains, consistent
with our disclosure obligations under the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

We expect the same high standards from all of our contractors, suppliers and other
business partners, and as part of our contracting processes, in the coming year we
will include speciﬁc prohibitions against the use of forced, compulsory or trafﬁcked
labour, or anyone held in slavery or servitude, whether adults or children, and we
expect that our suppliers will hold their own suppliers to the same high standards.
This policy applies to all persons working for us or on our behalf in any capacity,
including employees at all levels, directors, ofﬁcers, agency workers, seconded
workers, volunteers, interns, agents, contractors, external consultants, third-party
representatives and business partners. This policy does not form part of any
employee's contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE POLICY
• The board of directors has overall responsibility for ensuring this policy complies
with our legal and ethical obligations, and that all those under our control comply
with it
• The HR Manager has primary and day-to-day responsibility for implementing this
policy, monitoring its use and effectiveness, dealing with any queries about it, and
auditing internal control systems and procedures to ensure they are effective in
countering modern slavery
• Management at all levels are responsible for ensuring those reporting to them
understand and comply with this policy and are given adequate and regular training
on it and the issue of modern slavery in supply chains
• You are invited to comment on this policy and suggest ways in which it might be
improved. Comments, suggestions and queries are encouraged and should be
addressed to the HR Manager
COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICY
• You must ensure that you read, understand and comply with this policy
• The prevention, detection and reporting of modern slavery in any part of our
business or supply chains is the responsibility of all those working for us or under
our control. You are required to avoid any activity that might lead to, or suggest, a
breach of this policy
• You must notify your line manager and the HR Manager as soon as possible if you
believe or suspect that a conﬂict with this policy has occurred, or may occur in the
future
• You are encouraged to raise concerns about any issue or suspicion of modern
slavery in any parts of our business or supply chains of any supplier tier at the
earliest possible stage

• If you believe or suspect a breach of this policy has occurred or that it may occur
you must notify your line manager and the HR Manager OR report it in accordance
with our Whistleblowing Policy as soon as possible
• You should note that where appropriate, and with the welfare and safety of local
workers as a priority, we will give support and guidance to our suppliers to help
them address coercive, abusive and exploitative work practices in their own business
and supply chains
• If you are unsure about whether a particular act, the treatment of workers more
generally, or their working conditions within any tier of our supply chains
constitutes any of the various forms of modern slavery, raise it with the HR
Manager.
• We aim to encourage openness and will support anyone who raises genuine
concerns in good faith under this policy, even if they turn out to be mistaken. We are
committed to ensuring no one suffers any detrimental treatment as a result of
reporting in good faith their suspicion that modern slavery of whatever form is or
may be taking place in any part of our own business or in any of our supply chains.
Detrimental treatment includes dismissal, disciplinary action, threats or other
unfavourable treatment connected with raising a concern
• If you believe that you have suffered any such treatment, you should inform your
line manager immediately. If the matter is not remedied, and you are an employee,
you should raise it formally using our Grievance Procedure, which can be found in
the current staff handbook
COMMUNICATION AND AWARENESS OF THIS POLICY
Training on this policy, and on the risk our business faces from modern slavery in its
supply chains, forms part of the induction process for all individuals who work for
us, and updates will be provided using established methods of communication
between the business and you.
Our zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery must be communicated to all
suppliers, contractors and business partners at the outset of our business relationship
with them and reinforced as appropriate thereafter.
COORDINATION AND COOPERATION
Barker Ross has considered the risk to individuals and has developed processes to
ensure that the likelihood of occurrences of modern slavery occurring are
minimised. In our last ﬁnancial year Barker Ross paid over 12,000 unique
individuals. Of this number, we suspected 4 instances where individuals may have
been subject to exploitation under Modern Slavery. Each of theses instances were
reported to the GLAA and we were able to support the subsequent external
investigations.

Barker Ross has links with the Gangmaster and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA)
through its registration and certiﬁcation. Any allegations of abuse will be reported
to the Police and the GLAA and Barker Ross will work in partnership with these
bodies to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable workers.
It is our policy to monitor the well being of all workers covered by our GLAA
registration and ensure that our clients understand how important it is to our
business that all practices are fair, ethical and transparent.
Our registration process includes checks to monitor and audit details that have been
provided to us by candidates. All candidates are asked the ‘Stronger Together’
questions as part of their registration process and candidates are paid weekly, into
their own bank accounts. Any complaints or concerns raised by a worker will be
shared with the HR Manager and Managing Director. If a breach in legislation
appears to have occurred a report of our suspicions is made to the Police and to the
GLAA. Similarly, if a Recruitment Consultant is aware of an issue affecting the
workers, it is our policy that this concern be reported to the HR Manager to be
followed up and investigated, with further liaison with the GLAA and Police.
BREACHES OF THIS POLICY
Any employee who breaches this policy will face disciplinary action, which could
result in dismissal for misconduct or gross misconduct. We may terminate our
relationship with other individuals and organisations working on our behalf if they
breach this policy.

Communicate our zero-tolerance approach to
modern slavery with our supply chain and
business partners at the outset of our business
relationship with them.

Our employees are collectively and personally responsible
for the communication, understanding and practical
application of this policy. This policy will be made
available to all new employees at recruitment stage and
to our supply chain and to any other interested parties

Introduction
Walstead Group Limited (“Walstead”) is a socially responsible business headquartered in the UK. Walstead published its initial Modern
Slavery Statement in 2017 as required under the Modern Slavery Act of 2015. This document provided a brief overview of Walstead’s
business in the UK and the steps we took to manage the risks associated with modern slavery in the supply chain. The 2020 statement
will show what we have learned and expand upon Walstead’s aims for enabling continued transparency and vigilance in our employment
and procurement practices.
As the largest independent commercial web-offset printing group in Europe, we recognise that modern slavery, forced labour and child
labour are real issues of global concern. We understand the affect this has on individuals and communities and are aware that being a
European organisation does not insulate us from the effects of unethical practice directly on our shop floors, or indirectly through third
parties in our supply chain.

Our Business and Supply Chains
Walstead has grown by winning new business and by corporate acquisitions enabling the provision of a wide range of print and content
services for our customers. In the UK we operate as Walstead United Kingdom with seven sites including four print works, a bindery,
and two offices. Walstead also owns and operates Walstead Iberia, consisting of two print sites in Spain; Walstead Leykam, consisting of
five print sites in Austria, Czech Republic and Slovenia; and Walstead Central Europe, consisting of three print sites in Poland. Rhapsody,
the creative media production agency has three operations in the UK, Spain and Poland.
The size of Walstead’s offering enables us to serve a wide customer base including globally recognised blue- chip corporations, high
street brands and local businesses. We work in partnership with our clients to ensure our supply chain vendors meet the high standards
of social responsibility demanded by us as a business and by the end users of our products.
Our supply chain is complex and may consist of different tiers between our direct suppliers and the producers of raw materials. We
source our requirements from highly regarded global suppliers who enable us to rely on the integrity of their supply chain, particularly in
relation to suppliers of paper, inks and other constituent materials required for the manufacture of printed products.

Our Controls and Procedures
we continue to conduct training with relevant internal stakeholders and completed an internal audit of our UK subsidiaries and their
suppliers. We discovered that the areas of high risk are not large corporate suppliers, but more local and less publicly transparent service
providers. We identified that seasonal peaks and troughs in product demand means that our business uses contingent labour, which is a
widely accepted area of risk prone to potential abuse.
In addition to areas of risk exposed within our business through internal audit, we continue to issue modern slavery compliance
questionnaires to our suppliers, asking a range of questions including whether or not they are aware of the practice of modern slavery,
do they have any company standards, policies or other statements relating to human slavery and trafficking, do they audit their own
supply chain in relation to these issues, and have or do they intend to provide training for their workforce.

Thus far we have received a positive response from the majority of our suppliers and were able to identify, through lack of response, the
areas of highest risk. This enabled us to focus on improving awareness within our business, providing in-house training to teams that are
more likely to be affected by the issue. Additionally, we have issued a poster campaign in different languages to raise awareness on the
shop floor, providing a safe avenue for whistle blowing should any of our contingent workers be the victims of such practices or know of
anyone affected.

Future
We are continually trying to improve our modern slavery processes and we are working towards including a modern slavery awareness
module, which includes a training pack and video awareness, on our in-house training portal. We also intend to include modern slavery
awareness in our business inductions & refreshers which all employees must undertake. Modern slavery awareness is now included in
our tender processes & our modern slavery questionnaire will be issued when tendering supplies & services. Our modern slavery
questionnaire will also be issued to all new suppliers at point of implementing trading accounts. Walstead has continued to grow as a
business and since the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, we have not only become more aware of the issues and areas of
risk for our business but, more importantly, our responsibilities in relation to victims, the community and all our stakeholders. Our aim
is to introduce a European wide standard within Walstead Group that can enable the local sites and their suppliers to identify any
occurrence of practices that are deemed unlawful under the Act and to act accordingly, always considering the victim’s welfare first.
We will continue to perform due diligence exercises when on boarding new suppliers and work to place similar contractual obligations in
our contracts throughout Europe.
What is clear is that the purpose of the Act is to introduce a culture of transparency that can enable socially responsible businesses such
as ours and those of our suppliers to continue to develop awareness, raise standards and deliver an excellent service from a position of
ethical best practice, thus ensuring a viable and satisfactory experience for all stakeholders.

Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
United Response is a charity and private limited company providing care and support to vulnerable people in the UK. As such it is
regulated by Companies House and the Charity Commission.
The Board of Trustees oversee governance procedures and delegate responsibilities to subordinate committees and the Chief Executive
Officer.
The CEO is supported by the Directors’ Team and ongoing delegations of authority are allocated in accordance with the schedule of
delegated authorities.
The governance structure and performance are further strengthened by the controls exercised by the HR team as part of the
Recruitment and Selection Policy.
The Trustees and Directors’ Team of United Response are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking
in its supply chains or in any part of the business.
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk we seek to:
1. Identify and assess potential risk areas in our supply chains and workforce
2. Prevent the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring
3. Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains
4. Protect whistle blowers
United Response does not carry out work outside of the UK, nor does it seek to procure employees, supplies or services from outside
the EU.
United Response is governed by UK Law and as such is committed to and ensures that all employees are paid the national minimum
wage.
United Response also operates a whistleblowing process whereby staff confidentially report if they have concerns over slavery and
trafficking in the workplace. Staff can also seek advice from senior officers should they have any concerns.
As a leading social care provider in the UK, our policies reflect our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our trading
relationships.
We recognise that due to the vulnerabilities of some of the people we support they may be at risk of exploitation. We train our staff to
be aware of this risk and follow Adult Safeguarding Procedures to ensure that we manage this risk.
We undertake appropriate due diligence with regard to procurement of staff through agencies and other service providers to mitigate
the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring.
In view of the various checks and balances, the robust procurement mechanism, the whistleblowing process, and also the nature of the
work undertaken and staff training, United Response believes that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place within the
company or its supply chains.
We will continue to monitor the ways in which we tackle slavery and human trafficking within our sector and to seek to ensure that it
does not take place in any part of our business or supply chains.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes the slavery and human trafficking
statement for the financial year ending 31 March 2020.
Approved by the Board of United Response 16 July 2020.

This statement reflects the actions of The Cotton On Group (‘The Group’) which is made up of COGI Pty Ltd and
its controlled entities. The Group takes a zero tolerance approach to any form of modern slavery including
servitude, human trafficking and forced labour. We are committed to an ethical and transparent approach to
business, ensuring effective systems and controls are in place to safeguard against any form of modern slavery
within our business operations or our supply chain.
This statement sets out the steps the Group takes to address the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking
in our operations and supply chains. This is in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 in the United
Kingdom, the Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 in California, the Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth) in
Australia nationally, and the Modern Slavery Act 2018 (NSW) in New South Wales.
OUR BUSINESS
Established in 1991, the privately owned Cotton On Group is one of Australia’s largest fashion retailers. Our

operations consist of over 1,300+ stores in 20 countries and a team of 20,000 people. Our support offices are
located in Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Africa, Brazil, UK and the USA.
Our operations include distribution centres across Australia, New Zealand, United States, South Africa,
Singapore, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom. We also distribute products through third parties in Brazil and
Thailand. We have joint venture partners located in the Middle East, Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam.
Over the last 30 years, the Group has grown to eight brands including Cotton On, Cotton On KIDS, Cotton On
BODY, Rubi Shoes, factorie, Typo, Supré, Ceres Life and its philanthropic arm, the Cotton On Foundation. The
Group also owns and operates Southern Cross Shopfitting, employing people in retail store development and
construction.
Since day one, our purpose has been to make a positive difference in people’s lives. It sounds simple but it’s
something we take really seriously and it’s embedded firmly in our culture. As a global fashion business, we
know we have a responsibility to do the right thing, and this responsibility includes ensuring our supply chain is
both ethical and sustainable.
We source our materials and products from many countries worldwide, with the majority of our suppliers
located in China and Bangladesh. We’re proud of the great working relationships we have with each of our
suppliers and factories, and we continually work closely with them to ensure the environments in which our
products are made are safe, fair, sustainable and responsible.
ASSESSMENT
Our Ethical Sourcing Program, including our 14 Rules to Trade, was formalised in 2009 and governs the sourcing,
manufacturing and supply of our products. This supplier code of conduct aims to protect workers’ rights, the
environment, and strengthen our supplier relationships through our commitment to traceability, transparency,
and sustainability. Forced labour, child labour and minimum wage are all very serious matters that are
addressed with a zero tolerance stance in our 14 Rules to Trade.
As part of this program, all suppliers who manufacture goods for the Group undergo periodic audit assessments,
and based on the findings of these audits may be required to undertake corrective actions.
We identify opportunities to maximise our positive impact. We therefore concentrate our efforts on identifying
and remediating modern slavery risks related to our operations and the supply chains supplying products for our
customers. We recognise that other business relationships may also contribute or be linked to modern slavery
risks and endeavor to expand the scope of our program in the future.
Over the last 10 years, we have continued to build our Ethical Sourcing Program through the addition of new
resources and initiatives, working closely with suppliers, industry leaders, government and NGOs to ensure our
practices are reflective of industry standard.
ACTIONS TAKEN
Through our audit program, corrective action plans and NGO engagement, we have been able to determine the

high-risk areas of our supply chain and implement steps to mitigate risk in these areas.
Under our Ethical Sourcing Program, we have implemented stringent policies including the biannual re-signing
by each supplier of our 14 Rules to Trade, to ensure suppliers have a clear understanding of the Group’s
expectations and our zero tolerance approach to breaches.
To ensure a strong two-way dialogue with our production partners, we hold bi-annual supplier conferences in
our sourcing regions. These conferences are an opportunity to talk openly with suppliers on matters relating to
ethical sourcing, while providing them with an opportunity to update us on the challenges they face and the
steps they are making to bring about positive change.
The Group also holds face-to-face training and education sessions on all areas of human rights with owners,
manager and factory workers to ensure they understand the expectations to comply with our Code of Conduct
and 14 Rules To Trade. We maintain confidential in-country hotlines for workers to report any misconduct or
human rights breaches.
We have a number of internal policies to ensure we are conducting business in an ethical and transparent
manner, these include:
Supplier Agreements: These are signed biannually by our suppliers and outline the expectations for suppliers
who work with us. All suppliers including any subcontractors engaged by our suppliers must agree to and abide
by our code of conduct.
Traceability: The Group has traced 100 percent of its Tier 1, 2 and 3 suppliers and is working towards mapping
its entire supply chain, including Tier 4 raw materials by 2025. .
Auditing: Our suppliers are audited regularly, in partnership with our teams on the ground in our sourcing
regions, to ensure they’re adhering to our 14 Rules to Trade. Our Ethical Sourcing Audit consists 168 criterion on
topics across Management Controls, Facility Standards, Safety and the Environment. It is a requirement that all
suppliers disclose the details of their subcontractors.
Child Labour and Forced Labour Policy: This policy sets out our stance on modern slavery, human trafficking,
child labour and forced labour and explains the response and actions in the event that instances are identified.
Whistleblower Policy: We operate a whistleblower policy so that all team members know that they can raise
concerns about how colleagues are being treated, or practices within our business or supply chain, without fear
of reprisals.
In 2018 we joined the SEDEX platform for the secure exchange of ethical sourcing data with suppliers. Tier 1
suppliers are required to complete the SEDEX registration process and share external ethical sourcing audits
and non-conformances. When needed, we also work with third party auditors to ensure our factories remain
within their 12 month audit cycle.
The Group also collaborates with industry wide initiatives such as the Better Cotton Initiative; Action,
Collaboration, Transformation (ACT) on Living Wages; Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh to
inform and support the management of modern slavery risks.

MONITORING AND REMEDIATION
Before engaging with a new supplier, the Group conducts due diligence checks on the supplier. In doing so, the
Group maintains an approved supplier list and only these suppliers may be used for any stage of production.
These due diligence checks include a factory assessment and an audit assessment which include a review of
working conditions and building safety. In addition to the above, and as outlined in our code of conduct, we
require all existing suppliers to confirm to us that:
There is no inconsistency with the Cotton On Group code of conduct in any area of a supplier’s operations,
including subcontractors.
All employees are paid at least the national minimum wage in line with local labour law/regulations applicable
within their country of operation.
We may terminate the contract at any time should any instances of modern slavery or any other zero tolerance
breach of any human rights issues come to light.
We conduct internal training of our buying and sourcing teams to ensure they have a clear understanding of the
Group’s expectations for ethical sourcing. This includes training on understanding the signs of modern slavery
and what to do if they suspect any form of modern slavery is taking place within our supply chain.
VERIFICATION
We monitor the effectiveness of our Ethical Sourcing Program to ensure that slavery and/or human trafficking is
not taking place within our business or supply chain, through:
Reviewing any reports received from employees, the public, or law enforcement agencies to indicate that
modern slavery practices have been identified.
Remediation and management reporting of breaches identified by our audit program or confidential hotlines.
Annual review of our risk assessment process and audit programs to ensure they are relevant and up to date.
Our Group Sustainability Steering committee oversees the ethical sourcing strategy and framework in strict
accordance with the businesses values and ethical framework.
Regular training and capacity building for team members, third party auditors and suppliers.
Engagement with stakeholders to maintain a proactive dialogue on our performance.
COVID SUPPORT
Like many businesses around the world, 2020 challenged us. But with our Ethical Framework guiding our every
move, it’s been our priority to stand side by side with our suppliers.
Our people come first in every decision the Group makes. It’s no different for our suppliers and their factory
workers who are an extension of our global family.
• At the beginning of COVID-19, we immediately communicated our plan to our suppliers, detailing the ways in
which we were able to support them with all existing orders.

• We committed to all orders in our supply chain that were already in production pre-Covid-19, honouring
existing payment terms and pricing, redirecting excess stock to other markets where seasonally relevant and
repurposing fabrics into ranges landing later in the year.
• We expanded our Supplier Finance Program, enabling our partners in China and Bangladesh to access
payment within days of an invoice being issued.
• We worked closely with our partners to support them to create safer work environment in their factories.
In all that we do, the Group’s Ethical Sourcing Program is our baseline; it’s how we do business and aims to
protect workers’ rights and strengthen supplier relationships and commitments.
APPROVAL FOR THIS STATEMENT
This statement was approved on behalf of the Board of Directors on 29 March 2021 by Peter Johnson, CEO.
*As a result of COVID-19 and the impact to our supply chain, we have worked closely with suppliers to educate
them on our ethical sourcing program to ensure safety and compliance. As a result, our Modern Slavery
Statement for 2020 was delayed.

his statement has been published in
accordance with Section 54(1) of the
Modern Slavery Act 2015. It sets out
the steps that Costain has taken in 2018 to
prevent slavery and human trafficking taking
place in any part of its business, or that of
its supply chain. This statement is made on
behalf of Costain Group PLC and each of its
subsidiaries (*listed below) that are required
to make such a statement in accordance
with the Act.

Costain is committed to
operating responsibly,
particularly regarding human
rights issues and we will not
tolerate human trafficking or
other kinds of slavery within
our operations.

This is the third Modern Slavery Transparency
statement from Costain. In the past year we have
continued to increase our efforts to understand our
risks, raise awareness and engage with suppliers that
we have identified as high risk.
Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of our
fundamental human rights. It takes various forms,
such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory
labour and human trafficking. Costain is committed to
operating responsibly, particularly regarding human
rights issues and we will not tolerate human trafficking
or other kinds of slavery within our operations. We
firmly believe that nobody should be hurt or made
unwell because of the work we do, or services we
provide.
Costain helps to improve people’s lives by deploying
technology-based engineering solutions to meet
urgent national needs across the UK’s energy, water
and transportation infrastructures.

We have been shaping the world in which we live for
the past 154 years.
Costain's 4,000 people are committed to high
performance and safe delivery. We are delivering
a broad range of innovative services including
consultancy, technology, asset optimisation and
complex delivery services across a range of high
profile contracts in the UK incorporating the whole life
cycle of our clients' assets.
We buy a vast range of materials and services for the
operation of our business, including those used in
the development of the assets that we engineer. Our
supply chain consists of over 5,856 companies, 3,445
of which provide operational goods and services.
These companies are classified as strategic, preferred
and verified suppliers to Costain.

Our policies
We continually assess our responsible business processes and have appropriate whistleblowing procedures to
ensure their continued effectiveness. In 2016 we implemented our Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking policy,
making its requirements a mandatory condition of employment and a contractual condition for our suppliers. In
2018, we conducted a review of all our existing policies and and have made updates to more explicitly cover our
ethical labour stance.
Our suite of relevant policies, which are publicly available at costain.com, include:
•

Corporate Responsibility policy

•

People policy [covering labour and employment standards]

•

Ethical Business Conduct policy

•

Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking policy.

Partnerships
GLAA Construction Protocol
In 2018, Costain signed up to the Gangmasters and
Labour Abuse Authority’s Construction Protocol. This is
a joint industry agreement aimed at eradicating slavery
and labour exploitation, committing signatories to:
•

work in partnership to protect vulnerable workers

•

agree to share information, where possible, to help
stop or prevent the exploitation of workers

•

work together to manage information sensitively
and confidentially

•

commit to raising awareness within the supply chain

•

maintain momentum through this protocol by
communicating regularly.

Bright Future
Also, in 2018 Costain signed a partnership agreement
to become a Bright Future business partner. Bright
Future is an employment programme developed by
the Co-op with charity partners, to provide victims of
modern slavery with a pathway to paid employment
and reintegration into society. Working with charity
City Hearts, Costain has engaged strategic suppliers;
VGC, Danny Sullivan and Reliable Contractors to help
place victims on Costain contracts. We look forward
to reporting further progress on this partnership in our
next statement.
Supply Chain Sustainability School
Costain is a partner of the award winning Supply Chain
Sustainability School, a free training provider for the
industry covering a wide range of topics including
modern slavery. As a partner, we promote access to the
school’s resources to our supply chain and employees.

A slavery and human trafficking awareness training
workshop was delivered at our front-line supervisors
conference in 2018.
Raising awareness
We know that unethical labour practices, including
slavery and human trafficking are hidden. We have
robust policies and procedures in place setting out
our stance and how we must operate. We recognise
that raising awareness of the human rights aspects
of slavery and trafficking is a fundamental action in
bringing to light any issues within any part of our
business or our supply chain.
87% of employees performing the following roles
have completed mandatory modern slavery training:
executive board; commercial; contract management;
procurement/supply chain management; senior
management; facilities; human resources; internal
audit; legal; operational management and
procurement.
A slavery and human trafficking awareness training
workshop was delivered at our front-line supervisors
conference in 2018, using Stronger Together
resources to help highlight the tell-tale signs of a
victim. The front-line supervisors (works managers
and foremen) were tasked to identify actions that
they would take to raise awareness of the risk and
increase vigilance.

We have a dedicated confidential whistleblowing
helpline, which is available 24 hours a day and is
independently managed to ensure confidentiality.
There were no reports of human rights, slavery or
human trafficking via the whistleblowing line in 2018.
In addition to our whistleblowing helpline our
Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) is available
to provide support to all supply chain partners
as well as Costain employees on issues such
as financial, legal, workplace, consumer, family
and health. Over 20,000 employees and supply
chain partners working on Costain contracts have
access to the free confidential 24/7 advice service,
providing additional emotional support through
telephone or face-to-face counselling sessions.
All employees and supply chain staff are made
aware of the support available from the EAP
programme as part of the induction process and
have access to an online portal where they can
go for mini-health checks, personalised health risk
assessments and have access to fact sheets on a
broad range of health topics.

Risk assessment
Our risk assessment indicates that our exposure
remains unchanged and is highest within our supply
chain. We complete a supply chain risk assessment
that looks at the goods and services we procure,
reviewing the likelihood of the following three traits
of slavery and human trafficking occurring within a
supplier organisation:
• unfree recruitment
• work and life under duress
• impossibility of leaving an employer.
The supplier categories that we believe pose our
highest risk are those who provide labour in its various
forms. This conclusion is consistent with the industry
insight and advice we have obtained from experts.
In 2017 we focused on making sure that our
suppliers were legally compliant with regard to their
statements. This year we have taken this a step further
and are working with suppliers to ensure they have
action plans in place to prevent unethical labour
practices.
We have further developed the modern slavery
awareness module for Costain’s Supply Chain
Academy (SCA). The SCA supports small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) through 22 modules of free
industry best practice training, including a dedicated
module on slavery and human trafficking awareness.
The training uses materials from Stronger Together
and has helped the business leaders to develop a
50-point action plan to take away and implement.

Governance
Maintaining a high calibre supply chain is crucial
for Costain to help reduce risk and to develop high
performing strategic relationships. There are two
supplier assessment routes:
• externally via Achilles, a reputable accreditation
scheme provider (Building Confidence being the
preferred option, or UVDB, FPAL or Link-up)
• internally via the Costain materials, plant or
subcontract questionnaire (PQQ).
All preferred and strategic partners must be
accredited in one of the latter Achilles schemes.
Achilles as an independent partner verifies our
preferred and strategic partners against our
sustainable procurement requirements. Achilles
provide data to our buyers, identifying areas for
concern, potentially influencing procurement
decisions. Achilles also completes supplier audits on
behalf of Costain, this process includes compliance
with the Modern Slavery Act.
The Costain pre-qualification questionnaire (PQQ), is
used to verify our supplier base who are not classed
as strategic partners or preferred suppliers. The PQQ
requires suppliers to provide copies of their Modern
Slavery statement as part of the process.
In December, our procurement processes and
procedures were assessed to ISO 20400:2017
Sustainable Procurement. Independent assessment
against the guidance standard has helped us to
develop an action plan to further improve our
procurement processes and ensure that modern
slavery and ethics features prominently.

KPI’s
• 0 cases reported
• 100% of strategic partners with a turnover >£36m have a modern slavery statement
• 87% of identified employees have completed modern slavery awareness training

100% of strategic partners
with a turnover >£36m have a
modern slavery statement.

Next steps
Sharing best practice across the industry is an important step to help increase awareness, raise
standards and reduce risk. We will also continue to work with our clients, joint venture partners and
suppliers to share best practice.
In 2019, we plan to host an ethical labour supplier event, where we will work with higher risk suppliers
and key experts such as the GLAA, Supply Chain Sustainability School and Bright Future.
We have set a target that 100% of our relevant strategic supply chain partners will sign up to
the GLAA’s Construction Protocol to ensure greater collaboration in preventing unethical labour
practices.
Our Supply Chain Academy will continue to support SMEs and we will deliver further modern slavery
awareness modules.
This statement covers the period 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 and has been approved by
the board of directors of Costain Group PLC.

Anti-slavery and human trafficking statement 2019 2020
This statement has been published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015. It sets out
the steps taken by Collinson Group (“Collinson”) during the year ending 31 April 2020 to
combat modern slavery and human trafficking in its business and supply chains.

Introduction
The Modern Slavery Act 2015 requires commercial organisations supplying goods or services
with a turnover above £36 million to prepare and publish an annual 'Slavery and Human
Trafficking Statement'. The Statement must set out the steps an organisation has taken, if any,
during its financial year to ensure that slavery or human trafficking is not taking place in its
supply chain.

Collinson fully supports the objectives of the UK Modern Slavery Act and will not tolerate any
form of slavery. This statement sets out our approach to managing modern slavery risks in our
operations and supply chains. It relates to the actions and activities undertaken across our
organisation irrespective of turnover, to ensure slavery and human trafficking does not take
place internally or anywhere within its supply chain.
As an ethically driven company, Collinson respects the human rights of all those who work for
us directly and on our behalf. We will not accept any violation of these rights particularly in
relation to human trafficking and slavery in any form and actively work to ensure suppliers and
partners work in accordance to the same belief.

Our business
Collinson is a global loyalty and benefits company operating in over 20 countries throughout
the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa. We use our expertise and
products to craft customer experiences which enable some of the world’s best-known brands
to acquire, engage and retain customers. We aim to be a business that our clients want to work
with, and our people are proud to work for and be a place of innovation and creativity, driving
job satisfaction and a sense of belonging. We also aim to be a commercially successful and
trusted organisation with a social conscience, providing a share of our profits, assets and
people to enhance the communities and environments in which we operate.

people to enhance the communities and environments in which we operate.

But we don’t work alone - we rely on a global network of suppliers and partners to help us
deliver our innovative and customer focused solutions; and we don’t just work with anyone - we
are a value driven organisation and our values drive our decision making and reflect the way we
work, challenging us to push boundaries and make a positive impact globally.

Collinson expects that its employees, partners and suppliers work with integrity and maintain
robust standards of governance, seeking to avoid any decisions that may have a negative
societal impact. As a minimum we expect our partners and suppliers to:

comply with all applicable laws and regulations;

provide recurrent anti-bribery training to employees and ensure that no employee
intimates, offers, provides or accepts any form of bribe (or any other inappropriate type of
inducement) to or from any other individual, business or foreign public official;

not associate with any group that supports acts of violence or terrorism;
develop corporate initiatives that seek to improve the communities in which they operate;
and

raise any concerns about inappropriate conduct by Collinson, its employees, suppliers or
partners in confidence to a dedicated “Speak Up” line, or to Collinson’s Head of Internal
Audit or the Global People & Culture Director. The Collinson Whistle Blowing Policy is in
place to safeguard here and offer an alternative route to raising concerns.

We are guided by established standards such as the International Labour Organisation Core
Conventions, the United Nations Convention on Human Rights and the UK Modern Slavery Act
2015. We treat our employees with respect and dignity and expect the same of our partners
and suppliers. As a minimum we expect our partners and suppliers to:

provide a safe and hygienic working environment (and, where relevant, living quarters) for
all workers and proactively work to minimise health and safety risks through process
controls and training and ensure any incidents are logged and learnt from in a cycle of
continuous improvement;
ensure that all workers undertake work voluntarily with no incidences of forced,
compulsory, or bonded labour and no human trafficking;
provide all employees with a written employment contract that clearly explains their role,
delivery expectations, remuneration and rights and ensure that all reasonable steps are
taken to confirm that each employee has understood the contract prior to signature;

comply with applicable laws in respect of child employment and legal working age;

ensure workers are appropriately trained to carry out their roles and are fairly
remunerated in money and not in kind in accordance with any minimum wage
requirements at the very least;

not force workers to work excessive hours, ensure allowances are made for appropriate
breaks and any overtime is in accordance with applicable laws;

not restrict the right for employees to exercise freedom of association and collective
bargaining if such is in accordance with applicable laws or prevent the development of
alternative means of employee representation;

not require workers to lodge monies or identity papers in order to work and be free to
leave employment (after reasonable notice is given if required);

promote a diverse workplace, free from any form of discrimination or victimisation
grounded in (but not limited to) age, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity,

full review and update of our Sustainability Policy, covering key matters of both environmental
and societal concern.
Our core policies and processes are endorsed by our Board of Directors and have clear
ownership shared by our Director of Governance, Risk and Compliance, our Director of
Procurement and our Global Head of Corporate Social Responsibility.

When engaging with suppliers, we ask for evidence of their processes and policies,
including commitments around modern slavery, human trafﬁcking, forced labour, human
rights, and whistle-blowing.
We review the potential for risk at regular intervals, including the possibility of re-auditing a supplier or
conducting spot checks.

After due consideration, we have not identiﬁed any signiﬁcant risks of modern slavery,
forced labour, or human trafﬁcking in our supply chain. However, we continue to be alert to
the potential for problems.
Additionally, we have taken the following steps to minimise the possibility of any problems:

We reserve the right to conduct spot-checks of the businesses who supply us, in order to
investigate any complaints.
We require the businesses we work with to address modern slavery concerns in their
policies.
Our staff are encouraged to bring any concerns they have to the attention of Management.

Our Performance
As part of monitoring the performance of Stafﬁng 360 Solutions Limited we track the following general
key performance indicators:

indicators, which are regularly assessed by our senior leadership team:

The percentage of suppliers who provide their own modern slavery statements
The percentage of workers supplied from our preferred supplier list
The level of modern slavery training and awareness amongst our staff

We carefully consider our indicators in order to ensure that we do not put undue pressure on our
suppliers that might increase the potential for risk.

Our Training
All of our staff receive training and support that is appropriate to their role. In particular:

All of our staff receive awareness-raising information around issues involving modern slavery
and human trafﬁcking, so that they can bring any concerns they have to the attention of
management.
As part of this, our staff are encouraged to discuss any concerns that they have with the
Operations Director, Legal and Compliance (UK) or our Global Chief Operating Ofﬁcer.
Training is refreshed annually.

give rise to an enhanced risk of slavery or human trafficking. The company’s whistleblowing procedure
is designed to make it easy for all workers to make disclosures, without fear of retaliation.

Employee code of conduct
The company’s policies make it clear to employees the actions and behaviour expected of them when
representing the Company and strives to maintain the highest standards of employee conduct and
ethical behaviour when operating and managing its supply chain.
Supplier Procurement code of conduct
SQS is committed to ensuring that its suppliers adhere to the highest standards of ethics. Suppliers are
required to demonstrate that they provide safe working conditions where necessary, treat workers with
dignity and respect, and act ethically and within the law in their use of labour. SQS works with suppliers
to ensure that they meet the standards of the code and where necessary improve their worker's

termination of the business relationship.
Recruitment / Agency Workers policy:
SQS will only use approved reputable employment agencies if it needs to source labour and will always
verify the practices of any new agency it is using before accepting workers from that agency.

in relation to Slavery or Human Trafficking:
•
•

All potential workers undergo a selection process which checks the Right to Work in UK.
All payments made are equivalent to, or more than the National Minimum Wage (NMW)

Suppliers

necessary, treat workers with dignity and respect, and act ethically and within the law in their use of
labour. A robust Pre-Qualification Check takes place in the form of a comprehensive Pre-Qualification
Questionnaire (PQQ). In addition, SQS works with suppliers to ensure that they meet the standards of
the code. If a supplier was found to be in serious violations of the company’s supplier code of conduct
the business relationship will be terminated.

reviews of its existing suppliers appropriately. In addition, the Company’s due diligence includes:

MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT
FY 2018
This statement is made by Blue Prism Group plc (‘Blue Prism’) on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’)
in accordance with the requirements of section 54(2) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the Modern Slavery Act
2015 (Transparency in Supply Chains) Regulations 2015. It sets out the steps taken by Blue Prism Group plc and its
subsidiaries during the 2018 financial year.
ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE
The Group is headquartered in the UK and as at 30 April 2018 had 271 employees worldwide.
Blue Prism operates wholly owned subsidiary companies in the UK, US, France, Germany, India, Singapore, Hong
Kong, Japan and Australia all of which employ staff, lease premises and procure services.
ORGANISATIONAL POLICIES
Blue Prism has defined a set of common values:
P: We are Professional - smart in both thought and presentation
R: We argue passionately and openly but we have Respect for each other and a consensual style
I: We act with Integrity in our business dealings
S: We strive for Success - we are totally committed to being the best we can be
M: We eMpower our people to act in the interests of the company
These Blue Prism Values are reflected in everything that we do, beginning with the selection criteria used in the
employee recruitment process and continuing throughout all elements of the Company’s business. The Board
ensures that ethical behaviours are expected and followed by approving a set of internal policies on matters such
as anti-bribery and whistleblowing, and by ensuring that appropriate systems and controls are in place to ensure
compliance with those policies.
Blue Prism has reviewed all of its policies and made amendments where necessary to reduce the risk of modern
slavery in our business and our supply chains. The policies are readily available to all colleagues and will be reviewed
on a regular basis.
All Blue Prism employees have produced the necessary paperwork to show that they are legally entitled to work in
their country of employment and employment is not offered to anyone under the legal minimum age. Modern
slavery considerations are highlighted in the Blue Prism Employee Handbook and employees are encouraged to
refer to the Whistle-blowing Policy if they have concerns.
DUE DILIGENCE
Blue Prism develops its own software products in-house and therefore does not in general rely upon a third-party
supply chain to produce the products it sells in its core business. The Group’s supply base tends to be local service
providers or multi-national partners that have implemented robust Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking policies.

For each new supplier, due regard is given to ethical considerations including
modern slavery. The employee who is responsible for procuring particular goods or service is required to assess
the risk of modern slavery as part of any procurement or tender process.
Our purchase order system provides transparency of our suppliers. We currently have over 650 suppliers. Due
diligence takes place on each new supplier prior to adding them to the system. We take a risk-based approach to
due diligence based on a number of factors including value of the contract, type of contract and territory.
We do not currently consider any area of our supply chain to carry a high risk of modern slavery.
In the future, where high or medium risk areas are identified, appropriate steps will be taken to ensure that policies
exist, and contractual obligations are in force to minimise the possibility of slavery or human trafficking.

RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
Due to the nature of our business the Board considers Blue Prism’s business operations and supply chain to have a
low modern slavery risk overall. Any controls that have been put in place are considered proportionate to the
probability of occurrence, severity of the risk and the size and nature of the business.
The greatest risk of modern slavery in our business comes from hiring overseas employees and suppliers in
countries where the protections against modern slavery may not be as developed as they are in the UK. We work
with experienced partners when setting up our overseas offices to ensure stringent procedures are put in place to
mitigate this.

EFFECTIVENESS
The risk of modern slavery occurring in our business and supply chains is relatively low compared to other
companies however we do not view this as a sign to be complacent. Our culture, which is strongly embedded in
our operations, enhances protection against occurrences of modern slavery and the systems put in place, such as
our purchase order system, provides the transparency over suppliers that assures us the risk of modern slavery is
low. In the coming year we will work to enhance our due diligence of suppliers to further reduce the risk. As a
service provider we will work with our customers to provide them with assurances regarding modern slavery risk.

Approved by the Blue Prism Group plc Board on 16 October 2018.

Signed on behalf of the Board by Alastair Bathgate, CEO, Blue Prism Group plc on 16 October 2018.

Responsibilities
saha is constantly working on identifying how modern slavery and human trafficking may
affect our customers. We come across a wide range of customers who reflect a diverse
variety of backgrounds and needs. saha recognises that isolated residents and people with
learning difficulties may be particularly vulnerable or at risk. saha have an extensive and
robust framework of policies, procedures and contractual requirements in place which
contribute towards the prevention of slavery or human trafficking within our organisation and
our supply chains Effective implementation of these policies and procedures ensure saha
conducts business in an ethical and transparent manner. All policies are reviewed by the

Executive and Senior Management team and key policies are approved by the
Board/Committee, on a rolling basis in response to audit, statutory or regulatory changes
and feedback from customers and partners.
Procurement and Supply Chain
The Association is committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human
trafficking in its supply chains or in any part of its business. We manage projects and
procurements where services and products are sourced from suppliers. Most of these
products are not sourced by us directly but are sourced by our contracted suppliers of
services, goods and works. As an organisation that does not wish to work with any business
knowingly involved in slavery or human trafficking in any part of its operations, we take the
following steps:
Require new suppliers to declare that they are not involved in slavery or human trafficking
and have not been subject to any investigation in connection with any offence involving
slavery or human trafficking
Incorporate provisions in our contract and sub-contract documentation requiring our
suppliers to take appropriate steps to ensure that there is no slavery or human trafficking in
their supply chains
Include within all tender documentation instructions that we expect all suppliers to comply
with the Modern Slavery Act
All suppliers must complete and sign the saha Contractors Code of Conduct agreement
stipulating that they comply with the Modern Slavery Act
Work collaboratively with suppliers identifying those procured goods/services which may
carry the highest risk of modern slavery within their supply chain and requiring our
suppliers/contractors to confirm the steps taken to ensure there is no slavery or human
trafficking in their supply chains
Provide within all new tender documentation a copy of saha’s Anti-Slavery Factsheet which
highlights key risk areas and details supplier commitments to remain vigilant and comply
with all relevant policies and laws
A whistleblowing policy for all staff.
saha undertakes all procurement activity via its dedicated procurement portal, this means
all activity is managed and recorded in an ethical and transparent manner, saha has robust
procurement processes in place meaning it only engages with reputable suppliers and
contractors who adhere to appropriate legislation, regulation and practices.
Recruitment
As an equal opportunities’ employer saha has clear recruitment procedures and processes
including Right to Work checks for all permanent and interim employees. We ensure that
where agency workers are used, these are only sourced from reputable employment
agencies. Using this approach, we seek to avoid inadvertently engaging those who present
as looking for work for themselves but who are actually ‘controlled’ by others. We also

ensure that these partners apply HR good practices and processes including Right to Work
checks and saha has access to these records and carries out regular audits to ensure they
are up to date and accurate.
All new saha employees receive induction training on equality and diversity which seeks to
recognise and work with vulnerable people and children in our communities.
Specialist training is provided for all front-line employees in safeguarding, domestic abuse
and violence services, including identifying potential cases of modern slavery and human
trafficking and how to report them.
Code of Conduct
All saha managers and employees must adhere to a Code of Conduct which clearly sets out
expected standards of behaviour. The Code requires employees to act with honesty,
integrity, report misconduct and take responsibility for safeguarding.
Safeguarding
All employees are expected as a minimum to complete our mandatory e-learning module
within the required timeframe. Face-to-face Safeguarding training is mandatory for all clientfacing employees. We monitor compliance via our People Services Team (HR).
Investigations/Due Diligence
Members of the Senior Management Team are responsible for investigations and due
diligence in relation to known or suspected instances of slavery or human trafficking
Future Action
saha will continue to take action and improve its procedures in relation to modern slavery to
mitigate risk and will continue to raise awareness and deliver training to new and existing
employees and will extend this to its suppliers and contractors, where appropriate.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets
out the steps that Salvation Army Housing Association (saha) has taken and continues to
take to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place within the Association
or its supply chain.
This statement has been approved by the Association’s Group Board.

(‘the Act’) and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement. The firm’s
financial year concludes on 30 June; therefore, this statement covers the period 1 July
2019 – 30 June 2020. This statement was approved by the Minster Law Board of
Directors on 4 November 2020 and signed by our CEO, Shirley Woolham. A signed copy
of this statement can be provided on request.
As a firm of solicitors, Minster Law remain conscious of our legal and regulatory
responsibilities to act ethically, with integrity, in a way that upholds the constitutional
principle of the rule of law and the proper administration of justice to inspire public trust
and confidence in the profession. Against the backdrop of challenges facing all businesses
to adjust to the unforeseen impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, we remain committed to
taking steps to prevent slavery and human trafficking from arising within our organisation
and supply chains.

Our Structure
Minster Law Ltd, founded in 2003, is a limited company and a subsidiary to BHL (UK)
Holdings Limited. We provide legal services in England (registered number 4659625) and
are authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (registered number
383018) and the Financial Conduct Authority.
Minster Law works with insurers and brokers to provide their customers with market
leading motor related claims management and legal services, with a particular expertise in
personal injury.
Minster Law Ltd are one of the UK’s largest personal injury specialists. We have specific
expertise in motor and bike accidents, as well as specialists supporting in consumer claims,
residential property disputes and employment law.
Regardless of the severity of personal injury, we have unrivalled expertise supporting all of
our insurers and brokers’ customers. This includes specialisms in complex brain, spinal
and amputee injuries as well as pioneering fast track operations and the evolution of
digital servicing.

Within our business
Remuneration
We have continued to ensure that our colleagues are paid at least the UK National Living
Wage. Within the last 12 months we have also conducted our annual role and salary
benchmarking review.

Wellbeing Committee
To further enhance the support offering available to our colleagues, in the last 12 months
we have launched our Wellbeing Programme. The aim of the Wellbeing Team is to provide
advice, support and tips to colleagues to improve their mental and physical health whilst
adapting to remote working and more generally.
It is hoped that this additional layer of support could also provide an alternative avenue
for colleagues to access support on a range of issues should they feel the need to do so.
Pre-Employment Checks
Our recruitment process is underpinned by our Recruitment, Selection and Referencing
Policy along with its associated guidance note which are reflective of our commitment to
the prevention of slavery and human trafficking.
All prospective colleagues continue to undergo various pre-employment checks to ensure
that our approach to recruitment and selection complements our aim to combat slavery
and human trafficking. These include but are not limited to verifying a prospective
colleague’s right to work in the UK. In the last year we have redefined and enhanced the
processes relating to some of these checks.
We have also enhanced our previous offering through the introduction of robust KPIs
around our pre-employment checks.

Our Policies
Our zero-tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking continues to be reflected in
our company policies which reinforce our commitment to conducting business in an
ethical, responsible and inclusive manner.
Key policies include our Recruitment and Selection Policy, Contract Approval and
Monitoring Policy, Internal and External Equal Opportunities Policies, Anti Bribery and
Corruption Policy, CSR Policy and Whistleblowing Policy.
Our policies are owned by an appropriate key stakeholder and reviewed annually by our
Executive Management Team to ensure they remain up to date and fit for purpose.
Approval following an annual review is obtained via our governance structure with the
majority of the key policies being Board reserved ensuring appropriate visibility at the
highest level.
Our colleagues can easily access our policies via our Learning Hub should they need to
refer to them.

Supplier Due Diligence Process
Minster Law remain committed to seeking out opportunities to work with organisations
who reflect our values and share our approach to conducting business in a fair, ethical,
responsible and transparent way.

Our supplier network largely provides us with goods and services which enable us to
service our clients.
As in previous years, our supplier due diligence process remains aligned to our opposition
to slavery and human trafficking.
Agreements with suppliers continue to feature commitments relating to modern slavery
and it is expected that organisations we work with will satisfy their obligations under the
Act. To this end, we continue to have a contractual right to audit key suppliers and our
external audit processes include examining compliance with the Act.
Over the last 12 months, we have finalised the development of our Enhanced Supplier
Framework. Key improvements arising out of this activity include the adoption of a riskbased approach to supplier due diligence which enables us to ensure areas presenting the
greatest risk are appropriately resourced. Additionally, due diligence activities are
completed by subject matter experts in the relevant business area as it is recognised, they
will be best placed to evaluate and take steps to mitigate any identified risks.

Risk Assessment
Minster Law has a defined and embedded risk management framework. The Corporate
Risk Register for Minster Law includes monitoring and managing risks around new and
existing partners and suppliers together with our legal and regulatory obligations.
Risk management activities in this area include the maintenance of a supplier audit plan.
All risks are owned, managed and monitored by a member of the Executive Team with
reporting into our monthly Executive Risk Meeting.

Training
We appreciate that a culture of compliance and knowledge are key to identifying and
tackling modern slavery and human trafficking.
The E-Learning provided to our colleagues on this topic is intended to equip everyone with
the practical tools they need to identify and report suspected instances via our internal
reporting processes. This is provided to colleagues joining the business as well as in the
form of mandatory E-Learning to existing colleagues at regular intervals.
In the last year, we have also expanded our training offering with the introduction of a
Learning Hub. This includes resources on various topics allowing colleagues to enhance
their knowledge.
We recognise that there may still opportunities to further enhance our training offering on
this topic and will seek to explore this in future.

Performance Indicators
Minster Law monitor the effectiveness of our procedures by:

• Monitoring the annual review of our policies;
• Monitoring completion of mandatory Elearning delivered to colleagues;
• Monitoring completion of pre-employment checks;
• Monitoring completion of the supplier audit schedule.
These factors are monitored as part of the key control framework for each applicable
business area.

Future Goals
Building on the steps Minster Law have taken to date, we have identified the following
areas of focus for the next financial year:
• Considering whether any enhancements can be made to our current approaches to
supplier auditing
• Considering whether we can extend our training offering

Tesco Mobile is a mobile virtual network operator and a joint venture between Tesco and Telefónica.
Our principal activities are the provision of prepay and pay monthly airtime services to consumers
under the Tesco Mobile brand. Sale of the airtime services and related devices are via the Tesco retail
network. Delivery of the airtime services are over Telefonica’s mobile communications network.
This statement is made pursuant to the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our slavery and
human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 December 2016. It details the steps we
have taken during the financial year to ensure that neither slavery nor human trafficking is taking
place in our supply chains or any part of our business and the action we intend to take in pursuit of our
ongoing commitment to maintaining high ethical standards.
Policies
As a business, we rely on both Tesco and Telefónica to procure and employ staff for our offices and
phone shops. We also rely on them to procure goods and services on our behalf. Accordingly, we
actively monitor and ensure that they have the appropriate policies in place for their employees and
suppliers which proactively address issues relating to ethical considerations like, labour,
environmental impact, and social contribution throughout their own supply chains. In the case of
Telefonica, these policies are encapsulated in their Supply Chain Sustainability Policy (Supply Chain

Sustainability Policy) and in the case of Tesco in their Code of Business Conduct
(www.tescoplc.com). We also have a whistle blowing policy in place which encourages our staff to
freely raise concerns.
Where we source suppliers directly, we have revised our contractual standards to ensure there is an
adherence to the polices we have in place from time to time to address issues of ethical trading. We
also ensure a right of audit for all our material supplier contracts.
Due diligence processes
We have confidence in the due diligence processes that our parent companies employ to identify and
mitigate the risk of any modern slavery or human trafficking taking place in any of their supply chains.
Tesco integrates the use of a due diligence platform to review suppliers specifically for issues related
to modern slavery and bribery & corruption as part of their on-boarding process. Our procurement
team has historically undertake their own due diligence and compliance checks as part of our supplier
on-boarding process, these regularly include site visits to suppliers.
Going forward, the procurement process will also now incorporate the use of Tesco’s due diligence
platform as part of the procurement process. In 2017, a team of Tesco Mobile senior staff will be
visiting the sites of our suppliers in India, our only non-UK based suppliers.
Training
All Tesco Mobile staff undertake mandatory online training, provided by either Tesco or Telefónica, in
various areas to educate them on the values of our parent companies and their zero tolerance
approaches to unethical trading.
Further Steps

1

We are continually reviewing and improving our processes and procedures to ensure we are doing all
we can as an organisation to prevent any modern slavery or human trafficking taking place in our
supply chains. We will work together with our staff and suppliers to safeguard the highest ethical
standards that we are committed to operate by.

The board of directors of Tesco Mobile have approved this statement at its board meeting on 13th
March 2017.

Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
May 2019

1. Introduction
Modern slavery is a crime resulting in an abhorrent abuse of human rights. This statement has been
prepared in line with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and outlines how the company proactively
manages and assesses its own operations alongside our suppliers to protect workers from being
abused and exploited in our own Company and our supply chain.
2. Definition
Our understanding of slavery and human trafficking is based on the definitions set out in the Modern
Slavery Act 2015 which highlights that slavery can occur in a number of forms and typically includes:
•

•

•

Slavery and servitude – the status or condition of a person over whom all or any of the
powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised. Since legal ‘ownership’ of a person
is not possible, the key element of slavery is the behaviour on the part of the offender as
he/she did own the person, which deprives the victim of their freedom. Servitude is the
obligation to provide services that is imposed by the use of coercion and includes the
obligation for a ‘serf’ to live on another person’s property with the impossibility of changing
his or her conditions.
Forced or compulsory labour – involves coercion, either direct threats of violence or more
subtle forms of compulsion. The key elements are that work or service is exacted from any
person under the menace of any penalty and for which the person has not offered
him/herself voluntarily.
Human trafficking – requires that a person arranges or facilitates the travel of another
person with a view to that person being exploited. The offence can be committed even
where the victim consents to travel. This reflects the fact that the victim may be deceived by
the promise of a better life or job or may be a child who is influenced to travel by an adult. In
addition, the exploitation of the potential victim does not need to have taken place for the
offence to be committed. It means that the arranging or facilitating of the movement of the
individual was with a view to exploiting them.

3. Responsibility
Whilst it is every employee’s responsibility to be aware of and highlight any areas of potential risk,
overall responsibility for ensuring that the Company, it’s associated organisations and supply chain
are compliant in relation to the Modern Slavery Act 2015 lies with the Managing Director.
4. Business Structure
Scenic Tours (UK) Ltd operate two brands in the UK travel market – Scenic and Emerald Waterways.
Both brands sell a mixture of river cruise, escorted tours and ocean cruise holidays to the UK source
market.

Scenic Tours (UK) Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Scenic Group who supply all the river
cruise, escorted tours and ocean cruise products that Scenic Tours (UK) Ltd sells. The Scenic Group is
a global travel business operating in many countries around the world.
5. Supply Chain
The Scenic Group provide all our travel product. Transportation is separately provided by a number
of leading global airline and travel partners.
6. Policy
The Scenic Group is committed to social and environmental responsibility and have zero tolerance
for slavery and human trafficking. We hold ourselves and our supply chain accountable and we fully
comply within the provision of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
We recognise that modern slavery is a complex supply chain issue and we work in partnership with
our customers, suppliers and other organisations to sustain long-term solutions to this issue.
We are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to
implement and enforce effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not
taking place anywhere in our supply chain.
7. Due Diligence in our Supply Chain
The risk of slavery and human trafficking within our organisation is substantially avoided and
mitigated as a result of strict policies and procedures as well as the controls built into our business
operations and the knowledge and skills of our staff in the Scenic Group. We asses risk based on a
number of factors including geographical risk indices pertaining to human rights, the level of supply
chain control, external government factors and levels of political stability.
We consider that the greatest risk (albeit small) of slavery and human trafficking is in our supply
chain where we undertake procurement activities and where operations and managerial oversight
are out of our direct control.
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk:
•
•
•

Where possible we build longstanding relationships with local suppliers and make clear our
expectations of the businesses behaviour;
We undertake all reasonable and practical steps, including accomodation inspections and
audits, to ensure that our standards are being implemented throughout the businesses of
our suppliers and that local legislation and regulation are complied with;
We expect each entity in the extended supply chain to at least, adopt ‘one-up’ due diligence
on the next link in the chain. It is not practical for us (and every other participant in the
chain) to have a direct relationship with all the links in the supply chain;

8. Involvement in Modern Slavery
The Scenic Group will assess any instances of non-compliance on a case by case basis and will then
tailor remedial action appropriately.

We will only trade with those who fully comply with this statement or those who are taking
verifiable steps towards compliance.
We reserve the right to terminate our relationship with a supplier if issues of non-compliance with
our policies are discovered and those of non-compliance are not addressed in a timely manner.
9. Training & Awareness
The Scenic Group will ensure that we have competent individuals within our Company who are
aware of the standards we require and are able to provide guidance and support to all employees to
ensure they understand the expected behaviour from both our Company and that of our supply
chain.
10. Review
This statement will be reviewed annually, unless circumstances dictate that it should be reviewed
and/or renewed more frequently.

This statement is made pursuant to Section 54, Part 6 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
About us
We are a UK FTSE listed company that offers gaming-based entertainment in venues and online through our Mecca, Grosvenor, Enracha and YoBingo brands.
This statement covers all companies within our group.
Our position
We are fully supportive of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and its intention to tackle modern
slavery in all its forms, including slavery, servitude, forced labour and trafficking.
Our policy
We have zero tolerance towards modern slavery.
We are committed to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to seek to
ensure that modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our business or supply chains.
Risk assessment
We operate primarily in Europe with limited supply chains and as such we believe that our
exposure to the risks of modern slavery is low.
However, we still recognise that there is scope for modern slavery to occur and this statement
sets out the steps we have taken to minimise this risk.
Our risk assessment will be kept under review and if circumstances change we will institute
additional actions accordingly.
Our workforce
We have approximately 8,400 employees engaged in the UK, Spain, Belgium, Malta and
Gibraltar.
We have a comprehensive suite of employee responsibility policies which are relevant to our
attempts to ensure that there is no modern slavery in any part of our work force. Our relevant
policies include:
•

Recruitment Policy;

•

Harassment and Bullying Policy;

•

Grievance Procedure;

•

Employment Eligibility Policy;

•

Equal Opportunities policy; and

•

Speaking Up (Whistleblowing) Policy.

We actively encourage our employees to raise any concerns.
We respect the right of freedom of association and support employee engagement,
representation and dialogue through open Business Forums and Team Forums.
We also support the ability of an employee to individually raise potential concerns or
grievances.
We apply our employment practices in line with legislation, including in respect of the
National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage and the elimination of discrimination in
the workplace.
These policies and procedures are maintained and implemented by our team of human
resource professionals, supported by our team of internal auditors.
Our supply chain
Our team of procurement professionals has reviewed our supply chain to evaluate modern
slavery risks, in accordance with guidance issued by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &
Supply. Risk factors include the commodity purchased and the supplier location.
Having conducted this evaluation, we consider the suppliers at most risk are those providing
manual labour in the development, refurbishment and maintenance of our venues and in the
sourcing of raw materials for our venues, such as food and drink.
To assist this process, a mandatory self -assessment questionnaire is to be completed when
listing our suppliers on the contract management portal. This supports us in understanding
their labour standards and will ultimately assist us in selecting only those suppliers whose
procedures and standards meet our policy requirements.
Our Procurement team is continuing to audit our at-risk suppliers, where suppliers are
required to demonstrate the processes they have in place to mitigate against human rights
and slavery issues within their own supply chain.
Education and training
This statement will be issued to all relevant employees to ensure a high level of understanding
of the risks of modern slavery in our business and supply chains.
Any suppliers considered at risk will be made aware of this policy and required to demonstrate
compliance through our contract management portal.
Effectiveness and performance review
We do not have key performance indicators at this time given our low risk assessment, but
this will be kept under review.
We will assess any instances of non-compliance with our policy on a case-by-case basis.
In relation to our own employment practices, we monitor and review:
•

Employee engagement scores; and

•

Issues raised through our Speaking Up (Whistleblowing) Policy

In relation to at-risk suppliers, we will only trade with those who comply with this policy or
who are taking verifiable steps towards compliance with it.
This statement has been approved by our Board of Directors, who will review and update it
as necessary on an annual basis.

About us
•

Chime is a sport, entertainment and communications group with approximately 2,500 employees working in
some 60 offices in 18 countries worldwide.

•

The Board of Directors of Chime are responsible for the overall strategic direction of the Group including
ensuring that systems of identification and management of risk, including the risk of slavery and human
trafficking in our business or supply chain, are robust and appropriate.

•

Our group is structured into five divisions: CSM in sport and entertainment; the VCCP Partnership in marketing
communications; OPEN Health in healthcare communications, public relations and market access; CIE in market
research; and the Chime Specialist Group in communications in specialist markets such as financial and
professional services, technology, sustainability and media planning. Each division has its own senior
management team responsible for the direction and focus of the agencies in that division and for implementing
policies adopted at a Group level.

•

Within each division we operate as a number of agencies reflecting different sector specialisms or areas of
focus. Each agency has its own management and reporting structures in addition to those identified above.

Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
Our approach
•

Our Responsible Business Code and Staff Code of Conduct are aligned with and support the United Nations’
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The Codes impose moral obligations on our employees and
those with whom we work to help us uphold the International Bill of Human Rights as well as the core
conventions of the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at
Work. All operating companies are required to adhere to these Codes and the implementation is determined at
division level and is each agency’s responsibility.

•

To raise awareness about the risks of modern slavery within our business and supply chain, we have provided
targeted training and we will be extending this training to other teams across the Group in the future.

•

Across each of our five divisions our work ranges from collection and analysis of data through to the creation of
ideas and concepts, people and product promotion, and event delivery and coordination. We also manufacture
and handle raw materials within our CSM division.

•

Notwithstanding the diverse nature of the services offered by our Group and the significant number of individuals
involved in delivering those services, the Group has assessed our business as low risk for modern slavery and
human trafficking issues. All of our businesses have comprehensive employment policies and practices including
flexible working, diversity and equal opportunities and grievance policies which minimise the risk of modern
slavery.

Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
•

Whilst our businesses engage with a broad range of suppliers worldwide we do not consider our supply chain to
be high risk for reasons set out below.

Assessment
•

In 2016/17 the Group undertook a review of its supply base with a view to identifying high risk suppliers or areas
for focus. As part of the initial assessment, each supplier was mapped and categorised by agency, category,
spend & geography).

•

Suppliers were placed into one of 23 spend categories, and the value and location of service provided / goods
delivered was identified.

•

This provided a data set to identify areas of spend across geographies, with risk territories identified by means of
the Modern Slavery Index.

•

Suppliers used by the Group were identified as typically falling within the following categories: professional
services, media buying, logistics delivery, venue hospitality, security services, transport and travel, cleaners and
maintenance. Goods that we purchase include items such as raw materials, merchandise, utilities and general
office equipment.

•

Overall, the risk assessment demonstrated that the majority of the Group’s primary tier suppliers are in low-risk
countries in accordance with the Modern Slavery Index.

Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
Next Steps
•

Our assessment identified that, whilst we can be confident there is little risk in our primary tier suppliers there
was insufficient understanding of the position further down the supply chain. Although this was not judged to be a
significant risk, it was determined that this should form the focus for further work and that advice and guidance
should be received in order to ensure that appropriate and proportionate controls and engagement are in place.

•

We continue to focus on ensuring that our processes have embedded within them a robust, systematic, risk
based approach to assessing the risk of modern slavery within our supply chain. In addition to the points above,
we continue to review our policies on a regular basis and are currently focussed on ensuring that we effectively
communicate our policies and training across the whole of our business. Steps include launching a new intranet.

•

We maintain a third party managed whistleblowing helpline throughout the business to which all employees have
access, including those in non-UK offices, if they feel they cannot raise their concerns internally. In our periodic
reminders to staff we will include the reporting of concerns in relation to supply chain management (including
modern slavery).

Tra cking Statement

This statement sets out our actions to understand all potential modern
slavery risks related to our
business and to put in place steps that are aimed at ensuring that there is no
slavery or human
tra cking in our business and supply chains. This statement relates to our
actions and activities during
the nancial year 1st April 2019 to 31st March 2020. As part of the
telecommunications sector, we
recognise that we have a responsibility to take a robust approach to slavery
and human tra cking.
We are absolutely committed to preventing slavery and human tra cking in
our corporate activities,
and to ensuring that our supply chains are free from slavery and human
tra cking.

Organisational Structure

We are a provider of network and communication services in a variety of
industries from
telecommunications and transport, to utilities and the emergency services.
We are a subsidiary of
Telent Limited, as is our sister recruitment company TSS Solutions Limited.

based in the UK and are geographically aligned to projects, supporting our
ethos of local support. We require our suppliers (including overseas suppliers
where required) to provide:
products ranging from low value commodities to high value innovative
equipment;
personnel ranging from low-skilled workers to strategically skilled

tra cking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. Our internal and
external Anti-Slavery Policies re ect our commitment to acting ethically and
with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and
enforcing e ective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human
tra cking is not taking place anywhere in our supply chains. Our external
Anti-Slavery Policy which our suppliers must comply with can be found at
https://telent.com/about/compliance-statements.

Due Diligence Processes for Slavery and Human
Tra cking
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk, we undertake due
diligence when taking on new
suppliers and regularly review existing suppliers. This includes:
broadly mapping the supply chain to assess particular product or
geographical risks of modern slavery and human tra cking;

evaluating the modern slavery and human tra cking risks of each new
supplier via a prequali cation questionnaire and reviewing on a regular
basis all aspects of the supply chain based on the supply chain mapping;
ensuring that all internal processes are being adhered to for example
ensuring that personnel provided by suppliers have a right to work in the
UK, ensuring that we do not sponsor new migrants into the UK, ensuring
that limited company contractors are paid into veri ed company bank
accounts and ensuring that suppliers of personnel do not use o -shore
payment solutions;
conducting on-site and remote supplier audits or assessments, which
have a greater degree of focus on slavery and human tra cking where a
supplier is considered to be higher risk;

actively encourage all Telent stakeholders including employees, suppliers
and their employees to speak up and inform us of any actual or suspected
malpractice. We therefore provide an anonymous reporting mechanism to
protect whistle-blowers which encourage individuals to
speak up without fear of reprisal, provide a formal approach to our
responses and boost our due diligence. Details can be found at
https://telent.com/speak-up; and
where violations are identi ed, supporting a supplier to implement a
corrective action plan with the aim of resolving violations within an agreed
time period, assisting to improve a suppliers' practices by sharing best in
class practices within an open forum and invoking sanctions against
suppliers that fail to improve their performance in line with an action plan
or seriously violate our supplier code of conduct which may include the
termination of the business relationship.
We have in place systems to:
identify and assess potential risk areas in our supply chains;

mitigate the risk of slavery and human tra cking occurring in our supply
chains;
monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains; and
protect whistle blowers.

Supplier Adherence to our Values
We have zero tolerance to slavery and human tra cking. To ensure that all
those in our supply chain comply with our values, we have implemented
processes to:

encourage our suppliers to cascade a similar process and expectation
within their own business and supply chain;
ensure adherence to our policies at supplier selection, on-boarding, risk
analysis, performance measurement and continual assessment; and
ensure that adherence to our policies is a contractual obligation in our
agreements with suppliers.
We have a committed compliance team, which includes stakeholders from
the following departments:
Legal;
Human Resources;
TSS Solutions; and
Procurement and Supply Chain.

clearly communicate our expectations to our supply chain in respect of
sustainability, anticorruption and bribery and ethical procurement;

Awareness Training
We have implemented an awareness training programme for our sta to
ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and
human tra cking in our supply chains and our business.

Monitoring Our E ectiveness in Combating
Slavery and Human Tra cking

Introduction
This statement sets out Lockesleys Electrical Services' actions to identify all potential modern slavery risks related to its business and to put in place
steps that are aimed at ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafﬁcking in its own business and its supply chains. This statement relates to
actions and activities during the ﬁnancial year 1st April 2016 to 31st March 2017.
As part of the electrical industry, the organisation recognises that it has a responsibility to take a robust approach to slavery and human trafﬁcking.
The organisation is absolutely committed to preventing slavery and human trafﬁcking in its corporate activities, and to ensuring that its supply chains
are free from slavery and human trafﬁcking.

Organisational Structure and Supply Chains
This statement covers the activities of Lockesleys Electrical Services Ltd.
We are a London based S.M.E providing an electrical installation and repairs service across a broad base of differing clients. These include
Social Landlords and private businesses.
The organisation currently operates in the following countries:
United Kingdom only
The following is the process by which the company assesses whether or not particular activities or countries are high risk in relation to slavery or
human trafﬁcking:
Lockesleys undertake a stringent risk assessment process in relation to our operations in trading in various locations in reference to slavery and
human trafﬁcking, ﬁrstly by an initial written questionnaire to be completed by all of our key suppliers, ensuring that they, the supplier, have strong
anti-slavery or human trafﬁcking policies in place, and these polices are enforced, and also that they, the supplier (and their supply chains) are
also fully compliant with the Modern Slavery Act of 2015.

High-risk activities
The following activities are considered to be at high risk of slavery or human trafﬁcking:
The key areas of our organisation's activities at a higher risk are the manufacture and production processes for our product lines,
much of this is not UK based, with the implication that the labour force used in these manufacturing processes is not fully visible to us
and so any workforce involved in this manufacturing process could potentially be exploited, or be high risk in relation to slavery or
human trafﬁcking, thus failing to meet one or more areas of policy and so not being compliant with the Modern Slavery Act of 2015.
Responsibility
Responsibility for the organisation's anti-slavery initiatives is as follows;
Policies: Our Owner is responsible for putting in place and reviewing policies and the process by which they were developed.
Risk assessments: The HR manager has broad organisational responsibility for human rights and modern slavery risk analysis,
looking at processes/ ongoing reviews/ regular actions in this area to ensure we are compliant, meeting the requirements of the act.

Investigations/due diligence: Our HR manager is responsible for investigations and due diligence in relation to known or suspected
instances of slavery and human trafﬁcking.
Training: Our HR manager is responsible for ensuring that all better understand and respond to the identiﬁed slavery and human
trafﬁcking risks.
Relevant policies
The organisation operates the following policies that describe its approach to the identiﬁcation of modern slavery risks and steps to be
taken to prevent slavery and human trafﬁcking in its operations.
Whistleblowing policy. The organisation encourages all its workers, customers and other business partners to report any concerns
related to the direct activities, or the supply chains of, the organisation. This includes any circumstances that may give rise to an
enhanced risk of slavery or human trafﬁcking. The organisation's whistleblowing procedure is designed to make it easy for workers to
make disclosures, without fear of retaliation. Employees, customers or others who have concerns can [use our conﬁdential
helpline/complete our conﬁdential disclosure form].
Employee code of conduct. The organisation's code makes clear to employees the actions and behaviour expected of them when
representing the organisation. The organisation strives to maintain the highest standards of employee conduct and ethical behaviour
when operating abroad and managing its supply chain.
Suppliers code of conduct. The organisation is committed to ensuring that its suppliers adhere to the highest standards of ethics.
Suppliers are required to demonstrate that they provide safe working conditions where necessary, treat workers with dignity and
respect, and act ethically and within the law in their use of labour.
Recruitment/Agency workers policy. The organisation uses only speciﬁed, reputable employment agencies to source labour and
always veriﬁes the practices of any new agency it is using before accepting workers from that agency.
Due diligence
The organisation undertakes due diligence when considering taking on new suppliers, and regularly reviews its existing suppliers. The
organisation's due diligence and reviews include:
mapping the supply chain broadly to assess particular product or geographical risks of modern slavery and human trafﬁcking;
evaluating the modern slavery and human trafﬁcking risks of each new supplier [this may be part of a more general human rights or
labour rights assessment];
reviewing on a regular basis all aspects of the supply chain based on the supply chain mapping;
where suppliers can be checked for their labour standards, compliance in general, and modern slavery and human trafﬁcking in
particular; and
Invoking sanctions against suppliers that fail to improve their performance in line with an action plan or seriously violate our supplier
code of conduct, including the termination of the business relationship.
Training
The organisation requires all staff within the organisation to complete training on modern slavery
The organisation's modern slavery training covers
our business's purchasing practices, which inﬂuence supply chain conditions and which should therefore be designed to prevent
purchases at unrealistically low prices, the use of labour engaged on unrealistically low wages or wages below a country's national
minimum wage, or the provision of products by an unrealistic deadline;
how to assess the risk of slavery and human trafﬁcking in relation to various aspects of the business, including resources and support
available;
how to identify the signs of slavery and human trafﬁcking;
what initial steps should be taken if slavery or human trafﬁcking is suspected;
how to escalate potential slavery or human trafﬁcking issues to the relevant parties within the organisation;
Approval
This statement has been approved by the organisation's Director, who will review and update it annually.

Statement on Modern Slavery - FY 2020-21
Context: Overview of CIMA and The Modern Slavery Act
About CIMA
The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), founded in 1919, is the world’s leading and
largest professional body of management accountants. CIMA helps individuals and businesses to
succeed by harnessing the full power of management accounting – not just accounting for the balance
sheet, but accounting for business.
We provide continuing professional development services, fund academic research, develop thought
leadership, monitor professional standards, maintain a code of ethics for members, and work with
external tuition providers and assessment services to provide the best study and examination experience.
In 2017, members of CIMA and AICPA formed the Association of International Certified Professional
Accountants to unite and strengthen the accounting profession globally. Representing an influential
network of more than 650,000 members and students in management and public accounting, the
Association prepares accountants for today’s challenges and tomorrow’s opportunities.
CIMA has 23 offices across the globe with a diverse range of suppliers. As CIMA expands its operations
globally, it takes great responsibility to ensure that its supply chains are vetted accordingly in respect of
modern slavery. The measures implemented to safeguard CIMA’s legal position is outlined in section 4.
The Modern Slavery Act 2015
The Modern Slavery Act came into force on 26 March 2015. The Act clarifies the existing offences of
slavery and human trafficking and introduces tougher penalties.
The Act includes a new requirement for commercial organisations such as CIMA to publish a statement
each financial year setting out the steps we have taken to ensure that no slavery or trafficking is taking
place in our business and supply chain.
The term ‘modern slavery’ describes exploitation so severe that people are not able to leave their place of
work. ‘Slavery’ refers to the condition of treating another person as if they were property, something to be
bought, sold, traded or even destroyed. Victims may be ‘owned’ by their employers, and controlled through
means including massive recruitment debts that they are unable to pay off, and threats of harm if they try
to leave. The significant characteristic of all forms of slavery is that they involve one person depriving
another person of their freedom.
Situations that may present a particular risk of modern slavery include:

Where workers have fewer protections through inadequate laws and regulations, weak or non-existent
enforcement, and poor business and government accountability;
Where there are high levels of poverty among workers;
Where there is widespread discrimination against certain types of workers (e.g. women and ethnic
groups);
Where there is widespread use of migrant workers;
In conflict zones, and;
In some specific high risk industries (typically industries involving raw materials).
The risk of modern slavery affects almost every industry globally. As well as the potential for legal
sanction, companies that fail to take effective action may also suffer severe reputational damage and loss
of market share. CIMA takes this risk very seriously.
Measures to address modern slavery in CIMA’s supply chains
CIMA has undertaken the following measures in order to manage the associated risks of modern slavery
in its supply chain:
CIMA Policy
CIMA has adopted the following policy on modern slavery:
“CIMA is committed to upholding the highest ethical and professional standards, and to maintaining public
confidence in management accounting. As part of that commitment, we will use our best endeavours to
identify and mitigate the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking by:
Never supporting or dealing with any business knowingly involved in slavery or human trafficking;
Ensuring our suppliers and business partners understand our expectations of what is acceptable
business behaviour, including this policy;
Where necessary asking our suppliers and business partners to adopt suitable anti-slavery and human
trafficking policies and procedures; and
Encouraging the reporting of concerns and provide appropriate protection for whistle blowers.
CIMA’s leadership team will ensure that staff are aware of this policy statement and that any further steps
are implemented to prevent slavery and human trafficking within CIMA and its supply chains.
This policy will be reviewed annually”
Staff are made aware of the Modern Slavery Policy and encourage to report any concerns they have to the
Senior Leadership Team.
Supplier policy
All supplier policies dealing with modern slavery will be vetted during any procurement processes to
ensure that they align with CIMA’s own policy.
Contract Provisions
CIMA will ensure that its contractual arrangements with new or existing suppliers support its modern
slavery policy.
Whistleblowing

CIMA will continue to encourage whistleblowing to identify breaches of policy and contractual provisions
in respect of modern slavery. Reporting systems are in place to ensure that whistle-blowers identities are
protected and that they have HR, Procurement and Senior Leadership support.
Supply Chain Assessment and Reviews
CIMA will seek to identify vulnerabilities through supply chain assessment and reviews. While it is
impractical for CIMA to audit and monitor each and every supplier in its entire supply chain at all levels,
CIMA will identify key vulnerabilities and will take a risk management approach to ethical procurement
and contracting. CIMA will ensure that its tender processes assist in assessing supplier compliance with
the law.
Action Planning
For situations where corrective action is required, CIMA management will seek to address any issues with
the appropriate level of management within the supplier. As a last resort, it may be necessary to terminate
a relationship with a supplier.
Report on the 2019 Financial Year
CIMA is not aware of any breach of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 in the context of its business operations
or amongst its current supply chain during the financial year 2019.

We have a physical location in all of the countries we do business in, and employ over
1500 staff worldwide.
Our Policy on Slavery and Human Traf cking
ICE is committed to ensuring that no instance of modern slavery or human traf cking
occurs in our supply chain or in any part of our business. Should such an event ever
occur, a zero tolerance approach will be taken towards the culprit.
ICE engages only with global banks and other trusted nancial institutions as part of
its core business, with the aim of upholding high standards in our trading around the
world, and ensuring that ICE is not part of any slavery or human traf cking chain.
Our Supply Chain
In order to deliver our services to customers and business partners, ICE’s supply
chains source foreign currency from global banking institutions or other reputable
foreign exchange providers in the locations where ICE does business.
Operating in the nancial services sector means that the risk of modern slavery or
human traf cking taking place in our supply chain is low. Nevertheless, we
understand the importance of combatting slavery and human traf cking, and fully
acknowledge our duty to take steps to tackle the issue.
Irrespective of the services Lenlyn receives from a supplier, we insist that their
obligations in respect of modern slavery and human traf cking must be to the same
high standards as our own.
Due Diligence Process
In order to identify and mitigate risk:
• We have completed a risk assessment to identify whether there is any risk of
modern slavery or human traf cking taking place in our business or through our
supply chain
• We have reviewed all relevant policies and procedures to ensure appropriate
reference and governance is in place across the business regarding modern slavery

• All ICE locations are operated by staff contractually employed by ICE, who
undertake employment screening, and whose records are kept in the relevant
regional HR of ce. Where temporary or contracting staff are employed, this is done
through reputable recruitment rms
• Every geographical location we do business in is operated by a Country Manager,
who is resident in that location. All Country Managers report either directly or
indirectly to a member of the Executive Committee, ensuring appropriate oversight
across the business. The expectations of business behaviour are clear and regularly
reinforced
• ICE holds long standing arrangements for its key suppliers that it enters into
contractual agreements with, conducting appropriate supplier due diligence at the
commencement of any such arrangement
• It is the expectation of ICE that all companies we choose to do business with will
have suitable modern slavery and human traf cking policies in place
• ICE has a global whistle-blowing policy in place, which is designed to encourage
and protect those staff members who identify unacceptable activity and feel
unable to escalate through traditional hierarchical channels.
Recruitment
ICE uses only speci ed, reputable employment agencies and recruitment methods to
source labour. We ensure appropriate controls are in place to ascertain that
employees have the right to work and are therefore protected by employment
legislation. This includes checking right-to-work documents, visas and passports.
We do not employ individuals that would be considered to be ‘child workers’. Young
and inexperienced workers may be employed or given work experience, but they are
subject to the rights and protections that we afford all workers.
Basic rights, which we expect all workers to enjoy as direct or indirect employees of
ICE, include:
• The right to a reasonable wage
• The right to a safe working environment
• The right to an appropriate level of annual leave and cover for periods of sickness

The following statement sets out the steps The Boston Consulting Group (""BCG"") has taken in relation to our
responsibilities under Section 54, Part 6 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (""MSA"") to ensure that slavery and
human trafficking is not taking place in any part of our business or our supply chains.
About The Boston Consulting Group
BCG is committed to running our business responsibly and to the highest ethical standards. BCG is a global
management consulting firm and the world’s leading advisor on business strategy. We partner with clients from
the private, public, and not-for-profit sectors in all regions to identify their highest value opportunities, address
their most critical challenges, and transform their enterprises. Our customised approach combines deep insight
into the dynamics of companies and markets with close collaboration at all levels of the client organisation. This
ensures that our clients achieve sustainable competitive advantage, build more capable organizations, and
secure lasting results.
Policies
BCG's culture is rooted in outstanding professional standards and whilst we do not currently have a specific
Modern Slavery Policy, we have a number of policies which govern our conduct, values and behaviour.
Our Code of Conduct sets out that all colleagues in the BCG community are personally accountable for behaving
in a manner that is professional, lawful, and in accordance with our values and policies. We encourage people to
report any behaviours or activities that they believe to be unethical or unlawful either to a trusted member of staff
or via our Ombudsman process. Our Code of Conduct is distributed annually to all staff who by return must
confirm they understand and are compliant with the Code. We work in adherence to our company values, which
include Integrity, Respect for the Individual and Diversity. Through our Code, our Values and the full range of our
policies, BCG is committed to ethical conduct in every aspect of its business.
We have zero-tolerance to slavery and human trafficking, and, consistent with BCG’s Values and Code of
Conduct, we have, within the last 12 months, developed a specific Supplier Code of Conduct (“SCOC”). The
SCOC is being rolled out on a phased basis and all suppliers will be required to adhere to it while conducting
business with or on behalf of BCG. The SCOC:
•
•
•

•

Requires our suppliers to conduct their business activities and operations with integrity and in full
compliance with applicable laws and regulations, with specific reference to the MSA;
Prohibits suppliers from using all forms of forced or compulsory labour, and from supporting any form of
human trafficking of involuntary labour;
Requires the maintenance and promotion of fundamental human rights, where employment decisions
are based on free choice without any coerced or prison labour, use of physical punishment or threats of
violence or other forms of physical, sexual, psychological or verbal abuse as a method of discipline or
control; and
Mandates compliance with all applicable wage, benefit and hour laws, health and safety legislation, local
and national minimum working age laws and prohibits suppliers from using child labour.

Ongoing Initiatives
In those parts of our business and supplier service categories where we assess or believe the potential risks of
modern slavery to be higher, such as facilities management, travel, utilities and contractors we are taking a
number of measures to reduce the risk. These include:
• Gaining further information from our Top 100 spend suppliers that fall into the aforementioned higher
risk service categories to understand what the supplier is doing to promote compliance within their own
supply chain;

5353 • Fax +44 20 7753 5750
REGISTERED IN LONDON OC359103

•

In accordance with the BCG SCOC suppliers must promptly inform a dedicated member of the BCG
Supplier Risk Management team when a situation develops that causes the Supplier to operate in
violation of the SCOC or as specified within their contractual agreement with BCG;

•

Conducting negative news searches on new suppliers for red flags of slavery for a six month duration
following the supplier on boarding; and

•

Continuous negative news monitoring of BCG’s critical suppliers.

Recognising the complex nature of modern slavery BCG continues to emphasise the importance of collaboration
with budget owners and buyers to inform and educate them on the risk of Modern Slavery in our supply chain
through its responsible purchasing policy and the Supplier Code of Conduct.

This statement is made pursuant of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out the steps that Getech Limited has taken
and is continuing to take to ensure that modern slavery or human trafficking is not taking place within our business or
supply chain.
Getech Limited are committed to acting ethically and with integrity and transparency in all business dealings and to
putting effective systems and controls in place to safeguard against any form of modern slavery taking place within the
business or our supply chain.

1.0 Introduction
Modern slavery encompasses slavery, servitude, human trafficking and forced labour.
This policy explains the Getech Limited approach to modern slavery and sets out what you should do if you believe
that any form of modern slavery is taking place within our business or supply chain.
This policy applies to all individuals working for Getech in any form, including agency workers, part time staff or
contractors.
This policy sets out the organisation’s stance on modern slavery and explains how employees can identify any
instances of this and where they can go for help.

2.0 Our business
The business profile of Getech Limited is sales, distribution and repair of computer equipment and peripherals.
Our code of business is that we expect our employees and suppliers to act in the manner in which we behave as an
organisation.

Getech Limited has a zero tolerance approach to any form of modern slavery. We are committed to acting ethically
and with integrity and transparency in all business dealings and to putting effective systems and controls in place to
safeguard against any form of modern slavery taking place within the business or our supply chain.

workers are not being exploited, that they are safe and that relevant employment, health and safety as well as human
rights laws and standards are being adhered to, including freedom of movement and communication.
We operate a robust recruitment policy, including conducting eligibility to work in the UK checks for all employees to
safeguard against human trafficking or individuals being forced to work against their will.
If we believe that these rules are not being adhered to, we will notify the relevant authorities.
The prevention, detection and reporting of modern slavery in any part of Getech Limited business or supply chain,
whether in the UK or abroad, is the responsibility of everyone working for the company, any activity that may lead to a
breach of this policy must be avoided and concerns should be reported immediately under the reporting procedure below.

4.0 Our suppliers
Getech Limited operates a supplier policy and maintains a preferred supplier list, we conduct due diligence on all
suppliers before allowing them to become a preferred supplier. This due diligence includes an online search to ensure
that particular organisation has never been convicted of offences relating to modern slavery.
Our anti-slavery policy forms part of our contract with all suppliers and they are required to confirm that no part of
their business operations contradicts this policy.

•

They hold their own suppliers to account over modern slavery

•

They pay their employees at least the national minimum wage/national living wage

•

We may terminate the contract at any time should any instances of modern slavery come to light

slavery and what to do if they suspect that it is taking place within our supply chain. Training is reviewed on an annual basis.

6.0 The procedure to follow

report it either by speaking to a director or your manager or by following the companies whistleblowing policy.
You should raise any concerns that you have as soon as possible, provided that it is safe to do so. If you are unsure
about whether a particular act, the treatment of workers, or their working conditions constitutes modern slavery,
please raise it with your director or line manager.
You can also call the Modern Slavery Helpline for advice and guidance on 0800 0121 700.
Getech Limited encourages openness and will support anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith under this
policy, even if they turn out to be mistaken. You will not suffer any detrimental treatment as a result of reporting in
good faith a suspicion that modern slavery is taking place in any part of the business or our supply chain.

whistle blowing and code of conduct

Modern Slavery Statement
Charco 2010 Limited, C.P. Hart and Sons Limited, European Bathrooms (Amersham) Limited and European
Bathrooms Limited (‘the Group’)

The Modern Slavery Act 2015 (‘the Act’) creates offences in respect of slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory
labour and human trafficking. The Group is committed to supporting both the aims and the letter of the Act, namely
to combat all forms of modern slavery and human trafficking and improve our practices across our group to help
achieve this.

Our Business
Charco 2010 Limited is a non-trading parent company. Its subsidiaries are C.P. Hart and Sons Limited, European
Bathrooms (Amersham) Limited and European Bathrooms Limited.
The Group has a global annual turnover of £45m.
C.P. Hart has been one of the UK’s leading bathroom retailers since 1937, with a history and heritage we are proud of.
We've always insisted on using the finest materials and advanced manufacturing techniques to guarantee our
customers receive luxury, high-quality products to help create their dream bathroom.
Charco 2010 Limited acquired European Bathrooms (Amersham) Limited and European Bathrooms Limited in June
2018 and has subsequently converted their showrooms in Amersham and Windsor to trade under the C.P. Hart brand
to increase access to our inspirational products and services across the UK.

Our People
As at 1st January 2019, C.P. Hart employed approximately 240 employees across 17 sites in the UK.
We are committed to conducting business strictly in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations in the UK,
including the Act and health & safety, environmental, anti-bribery, equality and employment legislation. This extends
to maintaining high standards of behaviour amongst our employees through our training and development initiatives.
We have established rigorous HR processes and controls to ensure:
•

All employees are assessed for their right to work in the UK

•

Workplace equality policies and practices are in place, promoted and implemented

•

Remuneration and benefit schemes comply with relevant UK employment legislation

We continually review and develop our policies, procedures and controls to ensure ethical and legal compliance.
We actively encourage our employees to confidentially report any concerns or breaches e.g. suspected unethical
behaviour and wrong-doing. We have an independent whistleblowing hotline to ensure that all of our employees have
a voice that will be heard in confidence – 24 hours a day, every day of the year. All matters raised either via
whistleblowing, through direct communication with management or highlighted by our auditing processes are
investigated and appropriate action is taken in accordance with our policies and procedures.

Our Supply Chains

We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or any part of
our business. Further, we are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to
implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place
anywhere in our supply chains.
We purchase and source products primarily from countries within the EU, including the UK, but also globally on a
much smaller scale. From the suppliers with whom we have direct purchasing relationships, we will seek assurance
during negotiations of the same high standards of corporate and ethical responsibility as we adhere to ourselves.
A proportion of our purchasing is through agents and intermediaries. Where this occurs, we recognise our ability to
influence labour standards and human rights further back along supply chains is limited to a degree, as we may be
only one of many customers in an extensive marketplace. Owing to this, we recognise that some countries in our
supply chain may present an increased risk of modern slavery. Accordingly, we will be committed to investigating
what more can be reasonably done in this regard to help our effectiveness at mitigating human trafficking and
promoting anti-slavery within our supply chain.

Further steps
In developing our response to, understanding and support of, the aims and requirements of the Act, going forward we
will over the next 12 months:
Launch our internal ‘Code of Conduct’ & ‘Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy’, which we have developed
this year
Develop a specific Modern Slavery Act training module which will be rolled out to all relevant colleagues during
2019
Bring our standpoint and responsibilities to the fore in our communications with all stakeholders
Establish a regular reporting cycle through our management team and board of directors
Obtain legal advice on further improving our supplier contracts more specifically to exclude modern slavery and
human trafficking
Develop a Purchasing ‘Code of Conduct’ that specifies supplier obligations and includes contractual compliances
clauses and KPIs regarding modern slavery and human trafficking
Assess and, where material to our business, implement any relevant emerging best practice, either specific and/or
applicable to our industry sector, related to the aims and objectives of the Act
Increasing our knowledge and understanding of labour standards in the countries outside the EU and North
America in our supply chain
Implementing various measures to identify and mitigate risk and building on the approach deployed to ensure
that we operate, as far as possible free from enforced labour, human trafficking and slavery.

Whilst we consider ourselves to be low risk, we will continue to review our processes and practices to ensure that we
identify and manage risks to establish our ongoing compliance with the Act.

Kenwood Travel Ltd Modern Day Slavery Statement 2019/20
Introduction:
Modern slavery and human trafficking are both acknowledged to be widespread and global problems. According to the Global Slavery
Index an estimated 40.3 million people live in some form of modern slavery today. Slavery and human trafficking exist in different forms,
but a general definition defines “slavery” as the state of being under the control of someone where a person is forced to work for another
or do so under threat of a penalty. “Human trafficking” refers to the arranging or facilitating the travel or transport of individuals for the
purpose of exploitation of that/those individual/s. We recognise that all businesses have a responsibility to work to prevent and eradicate
all forms of modern slavery, both in their own business and supply chains by promoting of ethical business practice and policy. At
Kenwood Travel, we are committed to improving our practices to ensure that slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in any part
of our business or supply chain. We expect the same commitment from our suppliers and business partners.

World Vision UK (WVUK) is a charity devoted to improving the lives of the world’s most
vulnerable children through child-focused international relief, development and advocacy. WVUK
works with children, families, communities, churches, other non-governmental organisations and
national and international authorities and governments to achieve the best outcomes for children.
WVUK has a zero-tolerance stance on acts of modern slavery and human trafficking. It is proactive in taking steps to prevent such acts occurring within its own supply chain and to ensure
that on programmes it only partners with organisations that also observe appropriate ethical
standards.
This is a slavery and human trafficking statement within the meaning of section 54 of the Modern
Slavery Act 2015 (the ‘Act’) for the financial year ended 30 September 2019 and outlines WVUK’s
continued efforts towards tackling modern slavery and human trafficking in its supply chain and
wider activities. The structure of this statement follows the order of section 54(5) of the Act.

Actions taken during the 2018-2019 financial year
During the 2018-2019 financial year, WVUK took the following steps to prevent modern slavery
and human trafficking from taking place within our supply chains:
The DFID UK Aid Connect grant, focussing on ‘Effective Approaches to End the Worst Forms
of Child Labour’, has enabled us (and will continue to do so in the coming years) to strengthen
our work on tackling modern slavery. The programme generates evidence of what works and
what doesn’t work in fragile contexts. It enables World Vision to contribute to the global evidence
base, including best practice in removing the worst forms of child labour from supply chains
through one aspect of the programme which focuses on engagement with the private sector and
bottom up supply chain mapping.
WVUK has updated grant funded project start up training for staff and partners seeking to
deliver projects in communities overseas. The training now includes a section on modern slavery.

Structure, Activities and Supply Chain

WVUK is a private company limited by guarantee incorporated in England and Wales and a
registered charity. The Board of Trustees of WVUK is responsible for the overall control of the
organisation, its strategic direction and ensuring that it is properly managed.

WV Partnership
WVUK is part of the World Vision Partnership (WV Partnership), a network of entities in a
voluntary partnership which works in close to 100 countries providing services to people
regardless of religion, race, ethnicity or gender. The WV Partnership comprises World Vision
International (WVI) (a US-incorporated legal entity which provides international coordination of
the WV Partnership) and its branch offices around the world, subsidiaries of WVI and other legal
entities across the world which are not WVI subsidiaries (together the ‘WV Partnership entities’).
WVUK forms part of the latter group.

Programme Delivery
WVUK is one of several ‘support offices’ which raise funds for the WV Partnership’s overseas
relief and development programmes. Programmes financed by WVUK-raised funds are usually
delivered by in-country WV Partnership entities, with appropriate technical and other support
provided by WVUK. Most of WVUK’s expenditure on overseas programmes is therefore made
through other WV Partnership entities. WVUK has a long-term relationship with other WV
Partnership entities and there is a culture of transparency within the WV Partnership. All WV
Partnership entities share the same zero-tolerance stance in relation to modern slavery and
human trafficking and comply with the WV partnership policy documents described below.
Programme expenditure is sometimes made through non-World Vision partners where this is
appropriate for effective implementation. This statement sets out the steps WVUK takes to
ensure that third parties engaged in WVUK-funded programmes are also taking appropriate steps
to mitigate the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking. This includes putting in place
appropriate community level feedback and complaints mechanisms.

UK operations
WVUK uses various suppliers to enable it to carry out its charitable activities, including in the
areas of fundraising, marketing, IT, office facilities and employment. WWUK does not work
directly with any suppliers in sectors which are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking such
as construction, farming or hospitality. However, WWUK remains vigilant and has policies and
procedures in place to mitigate the risk of human trafficking and modern slavery affecting its
supply chain.

Policies and Procedures
WVUK’s internal policies include those listed below. In addition, WVUK also adopts the WV
Partnership documents listed below. All of these have a role to play in tackling modern slavery.

WVUK

a) WVUK Ethical Policy – ensures that through due diligence procedures due consideration is
given to the track record of significant donors, partners or suppliers in areas including human
and/or workers’ rights and use of bonded or child labour.
b) WVUK Code of Conduct Policy - emphasises WVUK’s commitment to conduct that is ethical
and legal, that WVUK opposes illegal acts in any of its activities and that WVUK requires
adherence by personnel to all applicable laws and organisational policies.
c) WVUK Risk Management Policy - ensures effective management of risks to which WVUK is
exposed through its activities.
d) WVUK Whistleblowing Policy - refers to specific examples of misconduct, as well as illegal acts
generally.
e) WVUK Contract policy and Contract Policy Implementation Guide - reiterates that WVUK has
zero tolerance for human trafficking and provides that, where appropriate, counterparties may be
required to explain what processes and policies they have in place to safeguard against such
practices and contracts should reference and require compliance with the WVUK Safeguarding
Policy.

Safeguarding Policy and Behaviour Protocols
The WVUK Safeguarding Policy prohibits all WVUK representatives from hiring children in any
form of child labour (which we define as work that is mentally, physically, socially or morally
dangerous or harmful to children or that interferes with their schooling). The policy is reviewed
annually. The policy includes enhanced standards for reporting, prevention and managing
responses to harm or abuse of beneficiaries and associates.
The Behaviour Protocols are also reviewed annually and state clearly what is unacceptable
behaviour, including sexual abuse, other forms of abuse, humiliating, degrading or exploitative
behaviour, the hiring of children for any form of child labour which includes ‘house help’. These
Protocols have been communicated and are signed by employees, consultants, contractors and
third parties.

WV Partnership
WV Partnership Global Supply Chain Management Procurement Manual - requires consideration
to be given to the principles of sustainable procurement, including relating to social impact, when
making procurement decisions.
a) WV Partnership Guide to Humanitarian Standards - reminds staff involved in the
implementation of programmes of the risk of trafficking and directs staff to use socially
responsible businesses and local labour and ensure that procedures are in place to provide a
safe working environment and appropriate remuneration.
b) The WV Partnership Whistleblowing procedure - WV Partnership uses a leading third-party
provider of ethical reporting services to support the WV Partnership’s ‘whistleblowing’
mechanism. A confidential telephone hotline and on online reporting tool are available to staff,

partners in the field, contractors and others wishing to report suspected illegal or unethical
conduct by WV Partnership or its personnel. This includes reporting any concerns in relation to
modern slavery and human trafficking which may be taking place within WVUK's business or
supply chain. To make an online report, you can use the following link
www.worldvision.ethicspoint.com (http://www.worldvision.ethicspoint.com).

Due diligence
WVUK has due diligence procedures in place to minimise the risk of WVUK engaging directly
with an organisation involved in unethical practices or of such an organisation being involved in
any programme funded by WVUK.
For all new WVUK suppliers, regardless of value, WVUK requires a supplier selection
questionnaire to be completed. This requires WVUK staff to consider ethical purchasing as part of
the selection of suppliers. For significant suppliers, an ethical due diligence checklist must be
completed which requires staff to consider the track record of the supplier in areas including
human and workers’ rights and use of bonded or child labour.
In the context of programmes, WVUK requires all non-World Vision partners it engages to
complete a due diligence questionnaire. This questionnaire states that WVUK avoids any
association with bonded or child labour, slavery and human trafficking and asks potential partners
to confirm they have no association with such practices. In addition, partners are asked to
provide WVUK with a copy of their ethical policies, including in relation to labour practices and
human rights. Where a partner is going to be engaged by another WV Partnership entity in the
programme country, WVUK requires that WV Partnership entity to carry out appropriate due
diligence. WVUK staff review the results of this exercise to ensure that only entities which meet
WVUK’s standards are involved in WVUK-funded programmes.

Agreements
WVUK’s agreements with downstream partners on programmes, both WV Partnership entities
and non-World Vision partners, include obligations relating to workers’ rights, including that the
partner will not employ, enslave, engage or otherwise use forced labour, trafficked labour or child
labour.

Training available to staff
WVUK now includes an induction training module that includes a section on modern slavery. This
module has been made mandatory for all staff during the 2018/19 financial year. The module
provides guidance on what modern slavery is, who is affected, what the signs are and what staff
should do if they suspect that modern slavery is taking place.

Conclusion

Going forward, WVUK remains committed to keeping its policies, procedures and training under
review and updating these as needed in order to maximise the contribution it makes to efforts to
tackle modern slavery and human trafficking internationally.

This statement has been approved by the board of trustees of WVUK and signed on their
behalf on 22/11/2019.

MODERN
SLAVERY
STATEMENT

Arran Isle Limited and its Subsidiary Companies (“Arran Isle”) Modern Slavery Act 2015 Policy and Statement
2020
Modern slavery encompasses slavery, servitude, human trafficking and forced labour. The Arran Isle Group has a zero tolerance
approach to any form of modern slavery. Integrity and mutual respect are cornerstones of our business values. We are committed to
acting ethically and transparently in all business dealings. We are determined to have effective systems and controls in place to raise
awareness of, and to safeguard against, any form of modern slavery taking place within the Group or, to the best of our ability,
anywhere in the Group’s supply chain.
Our Business
This policy and statement covers all of our UK and Chinese businesses:
European Hardware businesses in the United Kingdom:
Heywood Williams Components Limited trading as Mila Hardware, as Window Ware and as Mila Maintenance
Carlisle Brass Limited trading as Carlisle Brass and as Eurolite.
Group sourcing and manufacturing operations in Asia - Heywood Williams Components Limited Ningbo Representative Office
and AI BEI XIN (Hangzhou) Machinery Ltd
Currently this policy and statement does not formally extend to our businesses in Europe. Local management teams are governed by
the Group’s overall philosophy regarding Modern Slavery and do share many common suppliers. We consider that the risk of modern
slavery being perpetrated in the supply chains of these businesses is low but keep the need for extending processes under review.
Our High Risk Areas
The Group recognises that exposure to modern slavery is likely to be more prevalent in low cost manufacturing regions and
countries such as the Far East and India. The majority of the Group’s product supply comes from China, including from our own
manufacturing facility. Here our China based Asian Sourcing Centre oversee a structured programme of vendor audits and regular
compliance testing. There is a strong focus on trying to prevent modern slavery in any form, with regular communication with
suppliers in addition to these processes.
Some limited product is sourced from a small number of well-established suppliers in India. All are visited on a regular basis by
Group employees trained to identify signs of modern slavery, as well as by our Indian agent. In 2019, we commenced a programme of
formal audits based on those conducted in China.
Our Policies
We operate policies to ensure that we conduct business in an ethical and transparent manner. These include:
Modern slavery policy. This policy and statement sets out the Group’s stance on modern slavery and explains how employees
can identify any instances of this and where they can go for help.
Recruitment policy. We operate a robust recruitment policy, including conducting eligibility to work checks for all employees in
each territory in which we operate, to safeguard against human trafficking or individuals being forced to work against their
will.
Whistleblowing policy. We operate a whistleblowing policy so that all employees know that they can raise concerns about how
colleagues are being treated, or practices within our businesses or supply chain, without fear of reprisals.
Code of business conduct. This code explains the way we behave as an organisation and how we expect our employees and
suppliers to act.
Our Suppliers
The Group operates a formal supplier management policy in the high risk territories described above, and as part of this, maintains
an approved supplier list. We conduct due diligence on all suppliers in these regions before allowing them to become an approved
supplier. This due diligence includes pre-approval audits and questionnaires, along with subsequent periodic on site audits which
include a review of working conditions and cover health and safety and worker welfare generally as well as modern slavery in
particular.
In the first instance, we will work with our suppliers to help them address any concerns we might identify, and will stop using
suppliers should any instances of modern slavery come to light which are not rectified promptly.
Training
We conduct appropriate training for our procurement/buying teams and senior managers, so that they understand the signs of
modern slavery and what to do if they suspect that it is taking place.

Reporting
If a Group employee becomes aware of or suspects that there may be the possibility of any modern slavery abuses occurring within
the Group or its supply chain, this must be reported immediately to the employee’s line manager and the business’s General
Manager or Managing Director. The claim will then be investigated immediately and the findings reported to the Head of Corporate
Services. If the employee does not feel comfortable reporting the matter via this route, or considers that the matter is not being
investigated fully or dealt with appropriately, the matter should be reported immediately using the Group’s Whistleblowing Policy
procedures which are widely publicised internally.
Our Performance Indicators
We monitor the effectiveness of the steps that we are taking to ensure that slavery and/or human trafficking is not taking place
within our businesses or supply chains by reviewing at Group Board level any reports that are received from employees, the public,
or law enforcement agencies indicating that modern slavery practices have been identified.
Progress in 2019
As well as commencing formal supplier audits in India which include checking for signs of modern slavery, the audit programme
used by our Asian sourcing centre was significantly expanded and enhanced with additional employee welfare aspects added.
Areas for Development
The following areas have been identified for consideration:
While forming a relatively minimal proportion of the Group’s supply, it is recognised that the audit process introduced in India
in 2019 needs to be further developed and expanded.
The Group also sources some product from Europe as well as a small amount from other locations. To date modern slavery
audit processes have not been implemented across this element of our supply chain, as our suppliers here are considered to
be low risk or low value. Our focus has been on covering the bulk of our supply from what we consider to be high risk areas.
However, we will be updating our risk assessments and considering applying processes more widely.
We plan to update agreements with suppliers regarding our expectations including in relation to modern slavery.
Impact of COVID-19
While the COVID-19 crisis has, and continues to impact on our audit processes and plans over 2020, having a team based in China
means we have been able to continue the programme. We are maintaining close contact with all our suppliers and endeavouring to
support them as much as possible.
Approval for this Statement
This statement, which covers the Group’s financial year to 31 December 2019, was approved by the Directors of Arran Isle Limited on
behalf of the Arran Isle Group. It will be reviewed annually and is pursuant to Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

NATIONAL VETERINARY SERVICES (NVS)
Introduction
This statement sets out NVS’s actions to understand all potential modern slavery risks related
to its business and to put in place steps that are aimed at ensuring that there is
no slavery or human trafficking in its own business and its supply chains.
As part of the Distribution and Logistics industry, the organisation recognises that it has a
responsibility to take a robust approach to slavery and human trafficking.
The organisation is absolutely committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking in its
corporate activities and to ensuring that its supply chains are free from slavery and human
trafficking.
Organisational structure and supply chains
This statement covers the activities of National Veterinary Services (NVS):
Business Activities: Supplying veterinary medicines, veterinary instruments,
equipment, consumables, pet products and accessories and the provision of IT
business solutions to the Veterinary industry.
Nature of Supply Chain: Our supply chain involves the sourcing of 3rd party
manufactured products for wholesaling to veterinary practices in the UK.
Countries of Operation and Supply: The organisation currently operates in the
United Kingdom
Risk Assessment
The following is the process by which the company assesses whether or not particular
activities or countries are high risk in relation to slavery or human trafficking:


We mainly source from UK suppliers and expect these entities to have suitable antislavery and human trafficking policies and processes and do not source from those
countries considered to be high risk as identified by the Global Slavery Index.

Responsibility
Responsibility for the organisation's anti-slavery initiatives is as follows:


Policies: We have a zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking. We expect all those
in our supply chain and contractors to comply with our values.



All Directors and Senior Managers are responsible for compliance in their respective
departments and for their supplier relationships.

Relevant policies
The organisation operates the following policies that describe its approach to the identification
of modern slavery risks and steps to be taken to prevent slavery and human trafficking in its
operations:


Whistleblowing policy - The organisation encourages all of its employees to report any
concerns related to the direct activities or the supply chains of the organisation. This
includes any circumstances that may give rise to an enhanced risk of slavery or human
trafficking. The organisation's whistleblowing procedure is designed to make it easy for
employees to make disclosures, without fear of retaliation. Employees who have
concerns can use our confidential helpline or EthicsPoint website.



Code of Business Conduct The organisation's code makes clear to relevant
employees the actions and behaviour expected of them when representing the
organisation. The organisation strives to maintain the highest standards of employee
conduct and ethical behaviour when operating abroad and managing its supply chain.



Agency workers policy: The organisation uses only specified, reputable employment
agencies to source labour and always verifies the practices of any new agency it is using
before accepting workers from that agency.

Due Diligence
The organisation undertakes due diligence when considering taking on new suppliers and
regularly reviews its existing suppliers. Within the organisation's due diligence and review
process:


It is our intention to provide all suppliers with our ethical trading statement (which
includes statements on slavery and human trafficking) and to require suppliers to sign
an annual declaration of compliance.



Where possible we build long standing relationships with suppliers and make clear our
expectations of business behaviour.



We will evaluate the modern slavery and human trafficking risks of each new supplier.



We will invoke sanctions against suppliers that fail to improve their performance in line
with an action plan.

Awareness-raising programme
The organisation raises awareness of modern slavery issues by distributing flyers to staff;
putting up posters across the organisation's premises, circulating emails and by including an
article in the employee newsletter.
The awareness campaign explains to staff:


the basic principles of the Modern Slavery Act 2015;



what employees can do to flag up potential slavery or human trafficking issues to the
relevant parties within the organisation; and



what external help is available, for example through the Modern Slavery Helpline.

Managing Director Approval
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and
constitutes our company’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year to the
30th April 2017. It has been approved by the organisations Managing Director who will review
and update it annually.

This statement focusses specifically on Kelda Group and Kelda Eurobond’s compliance with the Modern Slavery Act
2015 (the Act) and highlights the steps we take to assure there is no slavery or human trafficking occurring within the
organisation or its supply chains.
Kelda provides water and sewerage services to domestic and business customers across the UK and employs more
than 3,200 people. Kelda Group is a holding company for the following subsidiaries:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Yorkshire Water Services Limited (Yorkshire Water) - provides water and sewerage services to around 5
million people and 140,000 businesses in the Yorkshire region.
Kelda Water Services Limited (KWS) – operates water and waste water contracts across the UK.
Three Sixty Water Limited – offers water and waste water retail and added value services to non-household
customers across the UK.
KeyLand Developments Limited (KeyLand) – manages the Group's surplus property assets, either on its
own or in partnership with outside organisations.
Loop Customer Management Limited (Loop) – delivers customer service support to Yorkshire Water that
includes billing, debt recovery and incident management.
Kelda Transport Management Limited – provides operating licence compliance and promotes safe and
efficient practices for Yorkshire Water’s fleet of Large Goods Vehicles.

Kelda’s organisational structure and Group relationships are summarised here.
The Kelda Group Human Rights Policy recognises international human rights as set out in the Bill of Human Rights,
and the principles described in the UN Global Compact.
Risks to the Kelda Group associated with the Act are managed in accordance with the Kelda Group Risk Management
Policy. Specific materiality assessment is carried out across the supply chain by individual Procurement teams as
required.
Kelda operates solely within the UK and how we employ and treat our employees is managed consistently across
the Group by the Human Resources (HR) Directorate. As demonstrated by our Living Wage accreditation, we ensure
all direct employees are paid a wage that is over and above the statutory wage levels set by the UK Government. A
Living Wage clause is also included in supplier contracts to ensure qualifying contractors also receive at least the
Living Wage, including where working for a subcontractor. Any breach of these clauses can lead to termination of
the contract. Accreditation is externally assured by the Living Wage Foundation.
Kelda’s HR team have reviewed HR policies and procedures in light of the Act. We have developed an employee
guideline document on human trafficking, modern slavery and forced marriage to ensure our colleagues have access
to the information and support they require. We expect our employees to fully observe and adhere to these policies
and procedures.

Kelda Group supplier contract templates do not ordinarily mention and request compliance with individual Acts. Due
to the nature and extent of such laws, we do not mention them all specifically in our templates. These matters are
covered by an Applicable Law definition and associated wording which we include in all contracts.
Applicable Law means:
i)

any statute or regulations or other law, regulation or by-law or any rule, code, judgment, decision or
direction having the force of law; and

ii)

any regulation, rule, code, direction, determination, guidance or other document which does not have
the force of law but which a supplier of the Goods (acting in accordance with all of its obligations in
this Agreement) would comply with as a matter of customary good practice, of England and Wales
or any relevant part thereof, or of the European Union (to the extent relevant and applicable) or any
public body, authority, local or national agency, department, inspectorate, ministry, official or public
or statutory person (whether autonomous or not) which has appropriate jurisdiction.

In addition, Kelda Group has continued meeting its supply chain commitments on slavery and human trafficking by
continuing with the following steps during the 2017/18 financial year:
•
•
•
•

Initiated a supplier communication and contract amendment exercise as a result of the risk assessment
carried out by the Wilberforce Institute of Slavery and Emancipation (WISE) at the University of Hull.
Published the Kelda Group Sustainable Procurement Strategy and emphasised the importance of the act
through several supplier engagement days.
Maintained awareness across the Procurement & Contract Management function via individual procurement
risk assessments and enhanced contractual obligations.
We have included Modern Slavery specific pass/fail criteria for all Procurement led tender processes and
new vendor requests.

We support the aims of the Act and remain committed to ensuring the eradication of modern slavery and human
trafficking. We will continue to drive improvement on these matters throughout our business and supply chains.

Modern slavery statement
The Medical Defence Union Ltd Modern Slavery Act
and human tra cking statement
The Modern Slavery Act (2015) (the Act) requires any commercial organisation which supplies goods
or services, carries on business in the United Kingdom, and has a total turnover above a speci ed
level, to publish an annual slavery and human tra cking statement.
This statement relates to actions and activities undertaken during the nancial year 1 January 2019 to
31 December 2019 to ensure that modern slavery and human tra cking is not taking place in our
business or in our supply chain.

Organisation's structure
The Medical Defence Union Ltd (MDU) is a not-for-pro t mutual company limited by guarantee,
based in the UK. Its activities include the discretionary provision, in accordance with its
memorandum and articles of association, of indemnity and medico-legal and dento-legal services for
its members. The MDU represents members' medico-legal interests by informing and thereby
in uencing the government and other bodies on matters relating to healthcare law and the
regulatory environment with a view to ensuring that any changes in these areas are equitable and fair.
The MDU's operational activities, including membership administration, are undertaken by MDU
Services Limited (MDUSL). MDUSL is based in the UK and is authorised and regulated by the Financial
Conduct Authority for insurance mediation and consumer credit activities only.
MDU Investments Ltd (MDUIL) is based in the UK and manages investments on behalf of the MDU.
Funds are invested with third party investment managers and MDUIL does not undertake any direct
investment activity.
MDU Reinsurance Ltd is based in Guernsey and its primary function is to provide access to global
reinsurance markets for the business.

Policies in relation to slavery and human tra cking

The MDU has a zero-tolerance approach to slavery and human tra cking in its business and supply
chains. It is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all its business dealings and
relationships. We have long-established procedures to conduct checks to ensure that sta can legally
work in the UK. We also have procedures providing appropriate protection for sta reporting
concerns about non-compliance with laws, regulations and codes of practice relevant to our
business.
A stand-alone anti-modern slavery and human tra cking policy was approved during 2017 and has
been updated and republished for the year 2019.

Due diligence process in relation to slavery and human
tra cking in the MDU business and supply chains, and
steps to manage the modern slavery risk
Overall, the MDU's risks related to Modern Slavery Act compliance have been assessed as low.
Nevertheless, we risk assess new suppliers in order to identify their risk level in regards to slavery and
human tra cking. This risk assessment takes into consideration factors such as the supplier's sector,
geographical location, and materiality. In cases where the risk level is identi ed as being higher, we ask
suppliers to provide information about their own employment practices and supply chains. We seek
to ensure that there are appropriate contractual clauses in place with our suppliers which address
the risk of modern slavery, in particular, where suppliers are identi ed as bearing a higher risk of
modern slavery.

Training
The MDU board and senior management are briefed on the requirements of the Act on an annual
basis.
To ensure an appropriate level of understanding of the risks, training will continue to be provided to
sta as relevant.

Further steps
Going forward, we will continue to assess new suppliers for modern slavery and human tra cking
risk.
This statement will be reviewed annually.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Act and constitutes our anti-slavery and human
tra cking statement for the nancial year ended 31 December 2019.

Modern Slavery Statement 2016
Richard Branson and the Virgin Group support the global fight against labour abuse in supply
chains and are vocal champions of supply chain transparency.

Who we are
This statement is made by Virgin UK Holdings Limited (VUKH) whose ultimate parent company is
Virgin Group Holdings Limited (a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands which is wholly
owned by Sir Richard Branson). This statement is made in relation to VUKH’s supply chain, as well
as (1) those of the following of its subsidiary undertakings: Virgin Management Limited (VML), Virgin
Enterprises Limited (VEL), Virgin Holdings Limited (VHL) and VM Advisory Limited (together with
VUKH, VML, VEL and VHL, the “Virgin Management Companies”) and Virgin.com Limited,
Virgin Red Limited, Virgin Start Up Limited and (2) The Virgin Foundation (altogether, “Virgin”).
The Virgin Management Companies are the home of Virgin. We work alongside the Branson
family and promote the growth of the Virgin brand by developing and nurturing valuable Virgin
businesses. We aspire to change business for good.
We support the Branson family’s investments in the following sectors: travel & leisure, financial
services, health & wellness and mobile, media & technology. We oversee both branded and
unbranded investments and manage the portfolio of brand licensing agreements with all Virgin
companies.
The Virgin Management Companies are headquartered in London alongside Virgin.com, which
operates the Virgin website, social media and digital assets; Virgin Red, our members’ platform for
living a life more Virgin; Virgin Start Up, which provides government-backed loans to entrepreneurs
and The Virgin Foundation, known as Virgin Unite, our non-profit foundation uniting people and
supporting entrepreneurial ideas to create opportunities for a better world.

Our supply chains
Our supply chain includes professional services providers, brand and marketing consultants,
utilities, cleaning and waste management, IT equipment and other office-supply companies.
We also procure food and beverages for our offices, and occasionally clothing, such as t-shirts and
caps. Risks of labour abuse often occur in second and third tier suppliers in certain industries and
we are undertaking a comprehensive risk analysis to understand how this concerns our suppliers.
The relevant Virgin team receiving the goods or services is responsible for procuring them.

Our policy
Virgin is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships. We are
implementing effective systems to lessen the risk of slavery and human trafficking taking place
anywhere in our supply chains.
We have an Anti-Slavery Policy that sets out our approach to combatting slavery and human
trafficking in more detail as well as providing employees with guidance on how to report slavery
concerns using the separate Whistleblowing Policy.
In addition to managing our own supply chains, we actively encourage our investees, licensees
and suppliers to proactively manage material labour, social and environmental risks in their supply
chains, including taking steps to stamp out slavery and human trafficking.

Due diligence processes
We have a supply chain compliance programme to ensure all of our suppliers are aware of our
policy and are working to achieve best practice. So far we have developed a code of conduct,
which covers labour issues, and a questionnaire for suppliers, which monitors compliance with the
code of conduct. We will be asking suppliers to complete the questionnaire and seeking to impose
contractual commitments on suppliers to comply with the code of conduct. By the end of 2017 we
aim to have surveyed 75 per cent of all our suppliers by spend and any of those suppliers identified
as high risk. We aim for all of our supply chain to adhere to our code of conduct in future years.
We will also produce a risk-map of our various suppliers, to understand where the material risks
lie and ways to work together to change business for good. We will take a balanced approach to
ensuring supply chain compliance and in certain high risk sectors, like food and beverages and
clothing, consider using third party verification tools.

Non-compliance
If we find a supplier is non-compliant with our policies or cod e of conduct or provides inadequate
information, we will work with them to improve their performance. In cases of mater ial or
persistent non-compliance, we may consider terminating the business relationship as soon as
possible.
Team members who don’t follow the policy will be given the oppor tunity to receive additional
training. If their behaviour doesn’t improve, they may face disciplinary action.

Key performance indicators
We will track and report in future statements on key performance indicators including:
•

How our supply chain is performing against the compliance programme outlined above.

•

Percentage of Virgin employees involved in procurement who are trained on slavery issues in
the supply chain.

•

The results of our risk analysis exercise.

Training
We have held a town hall session for all V irgin team members to raise awareness of the scale of
modern slavery. We have also held training sessions to ensure that those employees particularly
involved in procuring services are aware of the Modern Slavery Act, understand our policy in
relation to slavery and human tra fficking and take practical steps to ensure we follow the policy.

Our Business
This statement covers all the businesses and brands within CH & Co Catering Group Limited,
whose head office is in England. A list of the registered companies sitting under CH & Co Catering
Group Limited (‘CH & Co Group’) is at the end of this statement.
CH & Co Group is a catering and hospitality provider with over 6000 employees and operates
more than 700 sites in the UK and Ireland, across the business and industry, healthcare,
education, and public catering sectors. This statement outlines the measures we have taken to
date and are continuing to take to ensure no slavery or human trafficking occurs in our business
or in our supply chains.
Our Supply Chain
Our supply chain includes the key product categories of Ambient, Frozen & Chilled Food, Fresh
Produce, Dairy, Fresh Meat, Beer, Wine and Spirits, Equipment & Disposables. With the recent
mergers & acquisitions, CH & Co Group aims to amalgamate all suppliers into a single set of
group-wide suppliers to minimise the risk of non-compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015
(the ‘Act’).
We are committed to ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafficking in our supply chain or

in any part of our business. Our Modern Slavery policy (publicly available on the company website
and available to employees on the company intranet) reflects our commitment to acting ethically
and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implement and enforce effective
systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our
supply chain or within our business. We also require our business partners to provide training to
their staff, suppliers and providers.
To ensure all those in our supply chain comply with our values we have in place a supply chain
compliance programme. This consists of structured contractual documentation (requiring
suppliers to commit to complying with all relevant laws and regulations, including those relating
to modern slavery and human trafficking) and a cyclical checking programme to ensure all
parties uphold their commitments in line with our values.
Last year we engaged a third party to complete a due diligence piece to assess our nominated
supply chain and to review suppliers' policies and processes.
This annual review ensures our suppliers are compliant or working towards compliance with the
requirements of the Act as they apply in relation to the size of each suppliers' business. We
continue to work with our suppliers to achieve 100% compliance in our supply chain and support
our suppliers to become compliant. This coming year we shall be reviewing our non-core
suppliers to ensure compliance.
Employees and agency workers
We have zero tolerance in relation to all our employees regarding slavery and human trafficking
which also applies to our dealings with staff agency companies. CH & Co Group has strict HR
policies and procedures which support the Act to protect against modern slavery and human
trafficking. These include carrying out pre-employment face to face interviews and checks of
identification and right to work documentation. There may also be a requirement on certain
contracts for employees to be vetted to a more stringent level, this will be client driven.
Reference checks are required for all new employees. It is also a requirement that all employees
are able to speak and understand the English language, so we can be confident employees will
understand our policies and procedures, internal communications and will be able to ask for help
should they require it. The business also insists that all employees have their own bank account
for the payment of wages.
The business carries out regular audits of its right to work and payroll information, which

includes ad hoc site visits to ensure compliance. We provide various routes for employees to
communicate with the business should bad practice be taking place and to allow people a
confidential route to whistle blow.
We actively support our supply chain suppliers in becoming and ensuring compliance with the
Modern Slavery Act and continue to check annually our suppliers and their compliance through
third party providers.
We have in place systems to:
Identify and assess potential risk areas in our supply chains;
Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our supply chains;
Confidential whistleblowing hotline available for all employees and agency workers;
Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains.
Effectiveness
CH&CO has introduced the following KPI’s to measure the performance of our anti-slavery
actions:
KPI 1: Number of employees receiving Modern Slavery Training
KPI 2: Number of potential instances of modern slavery investigated within our business
operations and supply chain”
Training
CH & Co Group recognises modern slavery is a crime and can take many forms, such as forced
labour, servitude, compulsory labour and human trafficking. We remain committed to improving
our practices to combat slavery and human trafficking. Our Modern Slavery policy is
communicated to all employees on our Company intranet to reinforce the policy. We ensure
information is cascaded down the company, raising awareness of Modern Slavery at all levels of
the business to all employees and new recruits are given specific training on what amounts to
Modern Slavery, what our policy means and who to report any issues to. We encourage our
employees to report any activity they believe to be unlawful and/or in breach of our policies and
standards. Employees have the opportunity to inform the business of any concerns relating to
potential risks or failures of our suppliers.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and
constitutes CH & Co Catering Group Limited's slavery and human trafficking statement for the

Introduction
This modern slavery statement (the ‘Statement’) is published by Miki Shoko Co., Ltd.
(‘Miki Shoko’) in accordance with the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the ‘Act’) 1. The
Statement covers Miki Shoko and all of the subsidiary companies detailed below. It
sets out the steps we have taken to comply with the Act and to prevent modern
slavery (including human trafficking) in our business and supply chain.

Organizational Structure, Business Description and Supply Chain
The Miki House Group develops, produces and sells children’s clothing and familyrelated goods. We also deliver cultural services including publication, education and
child rearing support. Our primary brand is Miki House.
The Miki House Group is comprised of the following companies: Miki Shoko Co.,
Ltd., Miki House Co., Ltd., Miki House Trade Co., Ltd., Miki House France S.A.R.L.,
Miki House Americas Inc., Miki House U.K. Ltd., Miki House Kosodate Soken Co.,
Ltd. and Miki House & Shogakukan Production Co. Ltd.
The Miki House Group has business operations in Japan, the United Kingdom, the
United States, France, China, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, the Russian
Federation, Ukraine, Canada, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore.
The Miki House Group procures goods and services from around the world.
However, most of our suppliers are located in Japan, China and Vietnam. We are in
the process of mapping our primary supply chain as part of our due diligence
process outlined below.
As of August 2019, the supply chain for Miki Shoko has been confirmed to have
minimum of 151 supplier factories. Looking at these in more detail, the suppliers can
be broadly grouped into three types: those that perform in-house manufacturing,
those with in-house manufacturing as well as outsourcing, or those that function as
so-called trading houses and for only outsourced manufacturing. Miki Shoko is
currently working to identify supplier factories. And in the future, it is also under
consideration to identify 2-Tier supplier factories and suppliers of raw materials.

All information and data used in this statement refer to those obtained by October 15, 2019.

The Supply Chain Structure of Miki Shoko (Final Assembly Only)

Additionally, there are 23,624 workers currently identified worldwide engaged at our
supplier factories. By country, it was confirmed that there were 3,860 people
engaged in manufacturing bases in Japan, and there were 10,881 in China, 8,324 in
Vietnam, 900 in Myanmar, and 352 in Thailand. These numbers include foreign
workers where the risk of modern slavery is high. (Refer to 7. Risks Related to
Foreign Workers in Due Diligence and Risk Management for Modern Slavery).

Policies Related to Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking
We recognize that the adoption of a clear policy framework is an essential foundation
to mitigate the risk of modern slavery and have adopted since 2017 the following
policies:
•
•
•

Policy on Human Rights for Suppliers
Code of Conduct for Suppliers
CSR Procurement Policy

The Policy on Human Rights for Suppliers outlines Miki Shoko’s commitment to
respect human rights and sets out the steps we are taking to realize our
commitment. Our Code of Conduct for Suppliers prohibits the use of forced labor and
child labor and outlines standards to ensure ethical recruitment practices.
In the assessment by RightsDD Limited (‘RightsDD’), it was proposed to incorporate
additional topics into the policy such as: the grievance mechanism; protection of
foreign workers; dormitories; extending Code of Conduct to the 2-Tier suppliers and
beyond, etc. Steps for these will be taken based on priority.

Due Diligence for Modern Slavery and Risk Management
Miki Shoko is committed to conducting due diligence to identify and address the risks
of modern slavery in its supply chain. In order to meet these commitments, we
engaged The Global Alliance for Sustainable Supply Chain (‘ASSC’) and RightsDD
in July 2019 to conduct due diligence of approximately 100 factories which supply
Miki Shoko to assess risk of modern slavery.
As part of the due diligence process, ASSC and RightsDD will identify risks and
strategies to manage and remediate the respective risks.
Furthermore, the due diligence process seeks to identify risks to workers, consistent
with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business & Human Rights.
Using proprietary technology from RightsDD and analysis of data obtained from
questionnaire surveys of suppliers in August 2019 by ASSC, ASSC and RightsDD
assessed primary supplier factories on the risk of modern slavery. ASSC and
RightsDD assessed and prioritized supplier factories for risk of modern slavery to
both identify a trend and prioritize by using a three-stage process (1. Implement due
diligence on risk of modern slavery at Miki Shoko and its supply chain, 2. Propose
risk handling measures, 3. Issue a statement on modern slavery) together with the
supplier questionnaire survey results. Risks have been categorized based on six
criteria: country, industry, product/service, adverse media reporting, risk mitigation
and employment type risk.

In addition, the evaluation of supplier factories obtained through SAQ surveys and
visitation surveys to supplier factories conducted jointly by Miki Shoko and ASSC is
also used as risk assessment information, which is described in detail below.

1. Country
Looking at the number of supplier factories by country for Miki Shoko and the
country-specific risks of supplier production bases, the largest number of supplier
factories was identified to be in Japan with 66, followed by China with 38, Vietnam
with 5, Thailand with 2 and Myanmar with one. Including their suppliers, it became
clear that Indonesia and others were part of the supply chain. Looking at the risk
indicators from RightsDD's own analysis of the countries where suppliers'
production bases are located, it showed that the highest number of suppliers were
in Myanmar, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and China in that order.
The geographical risks on the Miki Shoko supply chain can be mapped as shown
in the diagram below.

Highest Risk Countries related with Miki Shoko Supply Chain

Supplier factories have production operations in 15 countries. The following five countries are rated with
the highest risk (victims per 1,000 population):

2. Industries
Miki Shoko currently operates businesses in 15 industries from the industries
category list provided by RightsDD. Many of these, when viewed by industry and
product from the perspective of risks of modern slavery based on data on human
rights risks provided by US NGO Verité and US Department of Labor, “Leather &
Leather Products”, “Rubber & Plastic Footwear”, “Footwear ( No rubber)” and
“Dolls & Stuffed Toys” are identified as the industry sectors with the highest risk
of modern slavery.

3. Products/Services
Looking at the trends for risks by product, the risks in three product categories of
apparel, footwear and toys were particularly high, where these products were
mainly manufactured in China, Vietnam, and Thailand. The table below shows
the number of suppliers by high-risk product area.

4. Adverse Media
Miki Shoko was confronted with a report in 2016 that revealed serious human
rights violations against workers at supplier factories operating in Myanmar for
Miki House Trade. In response, Miki Shoko established a third-party committee
and conducted a survey and published a detailed report. Since then, Miki Shoko
understands the need to pay close attention to the labor environment and respect
for human rights in the supply chain and the importance of an effective monitoring
system, so that since 2017 we have been cooperating with NGOs and other
stakeholders to formulate CSR procurement policies, request compliance with
suppliers and conduct fact-finding surveys.

5. Risk Mitigation
In order for Miki Shoko to reduce the risk of modern slavery in the supply chain it
is important for suppliers to take steps to ensure that modern slavery does not
exist in their business activities and supply chains. These governance evaluations
for risk reduction were categorized into four levels on policy, process and
certification/initiative.
•
•
•

Policy: Is there a clear policy/framework to mitigate risk of modern slavery?
Process: Are there any programs to enhance training programs, complaints handling
mechanisms or effectiveness of policies?
Certification/Initiatives: Are you a member of a multi-stakeholder initiative?

The chart below shows the results of this analysis. 14% of all supplier factories rated
Tier 1 had the highest level of governance, and more than half (53%) were rated at
the lowest level of governance.

Supplier factories are analyzed into one of four governance tiers:

14%
11%

Tier 1 – highest level of governance
Tier 2
Tier 3

53%
22%

Tier 4 – weakest governance

In order to reduce the risk of modern slavery, it is important to raise the level of
governance that establishes and maintains a system to prevent the existence of
modern slavery. For this, it is important to develop policies that specifically prohibit
forced labor and child labor, develop and implement training programs that educate
workers about payments over minimum wages and modern labor risks, participate
in initiatives to handle complaint handling and improvement mechanisms,
independent audits, obtaining certification and address problems with modern
slavery. Based on due diligence evaluations we will promote these practices
together with our supplier factories.

6. Type of Employment
In the assessment for “Risks regarding Type of Employment,” the points verified
with three questions are used as indicators. The points were 1) Are the workers
employed at the supplier as permanent or non-permanent employees? 2) Are
placement agencies (agents) used to hire workers? and 3) Employment of foreign
workers.
Attempting to identify these three points through questionnaires with suppliers
yielded the following results.

7. Risks Regarding Foreign Workers
If you look at Miki Shoko's supply chain, foreign workers, which account for
approximately 5% of the total, are engaged at factories of primary suppliers.
It has been found that there are at least 26 supplier factories hiring foreign
workers with due diligence processes on human rights. It should be noted that
22 of these are supplier factories located in Japan that employ technical interns,
where they are mainly from China and Vietnam. Considering the percentage out
of the total for Miki Shoko that these supplier factories comprise and together
with the risk assessment obtained from the “Supplier Factories Survey on
Technical Intern Training Program” described later, we can conclude that the
priority for placing such measures in Japan is relatively high. When employing
foreign workers, the risk of being complicit to forced labor is thought to be
relatively high, so we believe it is important to continue to engage with factories
that we outsource manufacturing.

8. Research for Technical Intern Trainees in Japan
Regarding the above-mentioned issues related to the technical intern training
program in the supply chain in Japan, Miki Shoko conducted a questionnaire survey
in 2017 and on-site survey on 25 supplier factories from February 2018 to October
20192. In the survey, on-site surveys were made on the working environment and
working conditions of technical interns based on the Supplier Code of Conduct, and
any current issues that were recognized were shared with the managers and
administrators of the supplier factories. A drafting of an action plan to reduce risk
will now be studied. The following is an overview of the risks revealed through the
fact-finding survey.
・ Risk that foreign workers bear various expenses incurred for technical training
・ Risk of “debt-bondage” due to the above-mentioned worker burden
・ Inconsistencies to the practical training plan and the training being conducted
at a different location than in the filing, which are prohibited by the program
・ Limited guarantee on freedom of association
・ Unclear deductions from wages
・ Geographical restrictions on municipal services and their associated isolation
(social isolation)
・ Infringement on freedom to change jobs (due to the legal system of Japan)
・ Registering a subsidiary company with the same location to increase the
number of technical interns

2

The difference in the number of “companies that employ technical intern trainees” mentioned above is due to changes at the suppliers
since the time of the July 2019 SAQ survey.

Training on Modern Slavery and Whistleblowing System
Employees can approach the HR/labor department for any reporting within the Miki
Shoko Group and have individual consultations about them.
Regarding the current state of the whistleblowing system at the supplier factories,
according to the results of the 2019 SAQ questionnaire survey, 58% of supplier
factories responded that they had some kind of consultation desk, including internal
and external consultation desks and opinion boxes. However, it has become clear
that only 8% of supplier factories responded that they had set up a consultation desk
by a third-party organization and are accepting consultations via telephone or SNS.
We regard this as an area that needs to be improved.
DO YOU HAVE A CONSULTATION DESK FOR WORKERS?

A third-party consultation desk has been set up to receive consultations via telephone and SNS.
①第三者機関による相談窓⼝を設置し、電話やSNS等で相談を受け付けている。

In addition, a training session on modern slavery was held, where Board Directors
and director-level managers of Miki Shoko attended NGO-sponsored learning
sessions (such as the Foreign Workers Roundtable, organized by the Global Alliance
for Sustainable Supply Chain3). In the future, we believe it is necessary to expand
the scope of the training and consider support for employees to be able to develop
knowledge about modern slavery. Furthermore, we trained the production managers
with hands-on experience by accompanying field surveys conducted at supplier
factories.

Roadmap for the Mitigation of Risk of Modern Slavery
Based on the above assessment, Miki Shoko has identified the following initiatives as
priorities:
✔ Countries and products that should be prioritized
Ø Japan, followed by China and Vietnam as location of suppliers
Ø Apparel, footwear and toys as high-risk product categories.
✔ Policies: Review of related policies and supplier code of conduct
Ø Additional notes on dormitory
Ø Additional notes on grievance mechanism
Ø Additional consideration of notes for reducing burden to workers on
recruitment fees
Ø Request 2-Tier and beyond supplier factories to also comply with similar
standards
✔ Engagement with supplier factories
Ø Provision of training opportunities on modern slavery
Ø Follow-up after conducting a fact-finding survey
Ø Follow-up after SAQ survey
² Further improve transparency in the supply chain (specifying outsourced
factories)
² Share survey results and future issues with supplier factories
✔ Build a grievance mechanism for workers on the supply chain that is highly
effective and reliable
Ø Supplier factory/Worker Training Session
Ø Utilization of Workers Voice Application

Effectiveness in Ensuring Slavery is not Taking Place and Performance
Indicators
Since Miki Shoko commenced its modern slavery due diligence process in July
2019, we expect to conduct an assessment on the effectiveness of these measures
after a certain period of time has passed.
Authorization
This Statement on Modern Slavery was approved by Miki Shoko’s Board of Directors
on 25 November 2019.

An Introduction to Tideway’s Statement on modern slavery and human trafficking from the
Chief Executive Officer Andy Mitchell
According to International Labour Office (ILO) statistics, there has been an alarming increase
in human trafficking and modern slavery in recent years. The ILO estimates that, on any
given day, there were some 40million people in modern slavery worldwide. This includes
forced marriage, forced labour, servitude and human trafficking.
The Modern Slavery Act 2015 sought to put in place certain safeguards to help prevent
modern slavery human trafficking and forced labour. Tideway has zero tolerance to all forms
of exploitation, whether it be enslavement, people trafficking, racial intolerance, gender or
disability inequality. Our Modern slavery and human trafficking statement sets out the
steps the company is taking to ensure the Project and its supply chain adheres to all relevant
legislation and that our employment practices are fair, open and above board.
I am delighted to announce that 2018 saw Tideway Verified to the BRE Ethical Labour
Sourcing Standard. As you will see we are only the fourth company to become Verified and
the first Client organisation. We will continue to strive for this standard through 2019.
Tideway has sought and obtained assurances from our joint venture business partners
that the supply chains into the Project are free from such abuses. Our focus during 2019
will be on seeking more assurances and increased vigilance about modern slavery from
our joint venture partners, and supply chain.
I fully endorse Tideway’s third Modern slavery and human trafficking statement which we
will continue to review and update on an annual basis.

Andy Mitchell CBE FREng
Chief Executive Officer - Tideway

Modern Slavery and human
trafficking statement
2018/2019
Modern Slavery and human trafficking are atrocious forms of organised crime in which
people are treated as commodities and exploited for criminal gain. The International
Labour Organisation estimate that 40 million people (or three out of every thousand
people) worldwide are working in conditions of modern slavery many of whom are
trafficked persons. This shocking figure breaks down to includes 25million in forced
labour plus 15million in forced marriage.
Tideway are seeking to have a sector-leading approach to modern slavery with appropriate
and well communicated corporate policies, a due diligence programme based on supply chain
risk assessment and effective follow up with suppliers seen as vulnerable to modern Slavery.
Tideway are implementing an appropriate level of employee training and working closely with
their key suppliers to mitigate the risk of modern slavery within our supply chain.
The Structure of the Organisation
Bazalgette Tunnel Limited (“BTL”) is the licensed infrastructure provider set up to
finance, build, maintain and operate the Thames Tideway Tunnel. BTL trades as and
is known to the public as Tideway.
Tideway is owned by a consortium of investors that comprises Allianz, Amber Infrastructure,
Dalmore Capital and DIF.
Currently with around 400 employees and contractors, Tideway has its headquarters and
operates solely in the United Kingdom. The Thames Tideway project (the Project) is
organised into three business units: Tideway West, constructing the tunnel between Acton
and Fulham; Tideway Central, constructing the tunnel between Fulham and Blackfriars; and
Tideway East, constructing the tunnel between Bermondsey and Stratford.
The construction companies that comprise our supply chain include: Bam Nuttall Ltd,
Morgan Sindall PLC, Balfour Beatty Group, Ferrovial Agroman UK Ltd, Laing O’Rourke
Construction, Costain Ltd, Vinci Construction Grands Projets and Bachy Soletanche – these
are the joint venture consortiums contracted to build the tunnel and are joined by Amey who
are providing systems integration services.
Tideway’s Stance on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking
Tideway is committed to ensuring that there are no instances of Modern Slavery or human
trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. Tideway’s anti-slavery
stance reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business
relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure
modern slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in the Project.
In 2018 Tideway achieved the BRE (Building Research Establishment) Ethical labour
Sourcing Standard in accordance with BES 6002 (2017) and received a Statement of
verification as evidence of this achievement. The Building Research Establishment(“BRE”)
conducted interviews with various departments across Tideway to review the maturity of our
ethical supply chain practices, particularly in relation to our Modern Slavery Statement,
commitment to paying the London Living Wage and the responsible sourcing of materials.
This award is testament to our commitment to operating an ethical and transparent supply
chain.

Supplier Adherence to Our Values
Tideway has zero tolerance towards any form of modern slavery and human trafficking. To
ensure all those in our supply chain and our third-party contractors adhere to our values we
have in place a compliance programme which requires the joint venture consortiums to
ensure they are compliant with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and to provide confirmation of
that each year.
We expect our business partners, subcontractors and suppliers to:
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•

Ensure employees have the freedom to choose to work for them and to
end that employment after a mutually agreed notice period.
Ensure employment is not forced, bonded or non-voluntary prison labour.
Demonstrate a commitment to equality of opportunity for all individuals free
from discrimination and oppression.
Offer working hours that are not excessive and are compliant with national laws or
industry standards.
Have appropriate disciplinary, grievance and appeal procedures in place.
Have a confidential whistle-blowing process in place where all reported instances are
investigated thoroughly, with assurances given to the victims they may give evidence
without fear of conviction for offences committed in connection with their
enslavement or trafficking. (A person is not guilty of that offence if compelled to act
as a result of enslavement or relevant exploitation.)
Ensure appropriate health and safety measures are in place to protect the
workforce and the wider public.
Offer wages and benefits at least in line with industry benchmarks or national
minimums.
Commit to the eradication of recruitment fees stating that the costs of recruitment
should be borne by the employer and not by any employee

Due Diligence Processes for Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk, we have in place systems to:
I.
II.
III.
IV.
V.
VI.

Comply with the Ethical Trading initiative. We ask that our suppliers adhere to the ETI
base code.
Identify and assess potential risk areas to our supply chains
Mitigate the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains
Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains
Protect whistle-blowers with our anonymous hotline
Tideway and our joint venture consortiums participate in the Action Programme for
Responsible and Ethical Sourcing (APRES) and comply with the ILO’s Ethical Trading
Initiative

Procurement and Risk Assessment Strategy
Our procurement team have developed a Supply Chain Risk Assessment Process for
Modern Slavery. As a procurer of numerous goods and services, it is becoming increasingly
important that we undertake our own risk assessment of Modern Slavery in our supply chain.
Practices that come within the ambit of Modern Slavery are numerous, complex and hidden,
and to prioritise activity, Tideway has a strong risk assessment in place. Tideway have a list
of current suppliers providing a range of corporate services.
Tideway is required to ask itself if it sources goods or services from industries that have a
particular prevalence of modern slavery e.g. clothing and footwear, manufacturing,
agriculture, construction, mining, electronics, events/catering and cleaning services work?

To highlight the prevalence of modern slavery practices within our supply chain, Tideway
have used a methodology based on the Global Slavery Index
(https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/index) Whether we take a supplier through to further due
diligence on their practices, depends on our risk assessment, based on the answer to 3
questions. These questions are as follows:
1. Using the Global Slavery Index:
The Global Slavery Index includes a model of 24 variables which affect vulnerability to
enslavement, and cover:
- Political rights and safety
- Financial and health protections
- Protection for the most vulnerable
- Conflict.
Q1a) Does the supplier have a Vulnerability to Modern Slavery score of over 50 out of
100?
YES/NO
2. The second component of the Index is a score of government responses based on an
assessment of 98 indicators of good practice, taking into account factors such as whether
each country has the necessary laws in place, provides support to victims, and ensures the
application of labour standards to vulnerable populations.
3. Does the supplier have a Government Response Rating of CCC or below?
YES/NO
Any supplier with a YES response to Questions 1-3 will be required to provide further
information to Tideway in the form of a self-assessment questionnaire and Tideway will then
conduct a risk assessment based on the response from the supplier. Having established risk,
it is important that we conduct due diligence within our supply chains and operations to
understand whether there is evidence of modern slavery issues, and whether there are
sufficient controls in place within that organisation.
Tideway have undertaken the risk assessment for all our suppliers and have applied a red
RAG status on those suppliers answering a YES to the to one of the three questions. The
supplier assessment can be found in Appendix A of this document.
Following the supplier risk assessment, in October 2018 Tideway identified 15 suppliers from
which it wished to seek further information to identify whether there was a risk of Modern
Slavery occurring within their operations. Following further investigation via a structured
questionnaire, no discernible risks of modern slavery were identified and the suppliers were
able to satisfy Tideway that there were sufficient processes in place to mitigate such risks.
The risk assessment will be repeated on an annual basis
Right to Work
All our employees have a written contract of employment, and their right to work in the UK
is established prior to their employment commencing. All employees are made aware of
their statutory rights and in-work benefits during their induction process. We work with our
joint venture partners and supply chain to ensure that this is the case for all personnel
working on the project. Tideway's Onboarding process includes an automated red flag
raising system which identifies employees of Tideway, and employees of our Main Works
Contractors, who do not have the right work in the UK, who may not be earning the
London Living Wage, or whose domestic or travel arrangements appear unusual, and
require further investigation.

Policies and Training
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking
in the business, and in the supply chains we provide training to our staff during their induction
process and annually thereafter. In 2018/2019 all staff have been required to complete
training in Modern Slavery and Preventing Bribery in Business – both provided by an external
training supplier.
Tideway have the following policies which Tideway staff are required to read and become
familiar with during their time on the project:
•
•
•
•
•

Whistle-Blowing Policy – supported by the anonymous Crime Stoppers whistle
blowing hotline
Anti-Fraud, Corruption and Bribery Policy
Anti-Money Laundering Policy
Grievance Policy
Bullying and Harassment Policy

Tideway employees are encouraged to read and understand the relevant policies and
procedures, when they join the company and throughout their tenure at Tideway.
Tideway employees are given training in the key ethical and human rights topics which
support the above policies. Training sessions are a mixture of online learning, short
presentations and drop in sessions usually run by a member of the senior management
team. In 2018/2019 this included a specific Modern Slavery online course, which was
mandatory for all staff. It focusses on the importance of the Modern Slavery Act and how to
identify warning signs and anomalies in the workplace, and what to do about them, if
identified.
Tideway liaise with their Main Works Contractors to ensure that comparable policies, and
employee training is in place. In 2019 we are liaising with our MWCs to ensure that all staff
have access to Modern Slavery training during the year.
It is our intention going forward to continue to work closely with our partners and supply chain
in raising awareness of modern slavery, and in establishing effective mitigation protocols.

Financial year 2018/2019
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes McLaren
Group’s slavery and human trafficking statement, setting out the steps the group has taken to ensure that
slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in our supply chain or in any part of our business.
Introduction
Slavery and forced labour can take many forms, including human trafficking or child labour. This statement sets
out McLaren Group’s actions to understand all potential modern slavery risks. As part of the construction
industry, the company recognises that it has a responsibility to take a robust approach to preventing slavery and
human trafficking.
The company is absolutely committed to maintaining and improving systems and processes to prevent human
rights violations related to our own operations and those of our supply chain.
Organisational Structure
The McLaren Group of companies operates in construction, property investment and development, in the UK
and United Arab Emirates. It has permanent offices in Brentwood, London, Birmingham, Reading, Manchester
and Dubai.
Our Policies on Slavery and Human Trafficking
The Company is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to
implement and enforce effective systems and controls to, as far as practical, ensure slavery and human
trafficking is not taking place anywhere in the company or our supply chain. We comply with all legislation –
importantly the Immigration Act 2015 – to ensure we prevent any illegal working.
Our Supply Chain
Our supply chain comprises the engagement of sub-consultant and sub-contractor organisations to carry out
works and services on our construction sites, as well as the sourcing of materials and manufactured products.
We play an active role in supplier development and have adopted various means to clearly communicate our
expectations of suppliers.
As part of our work to identify and mitigate risk:
•
•
•

We build long-standing relationships with our suppliers, sub-consultants and subcontractors
and make clear our expectations of business behaviour.
We have in place systems to encourage the reporting of concerns and to protect whistle blowers.
We encourage anyone, including employees, sub-consultants, sub-contractors and suppliers, to report in
good faith any issues or concerns about potential or possible ethics, human rights, legal or regulatory
violations, including improper or unethical business practices.

Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy Statement

UK Supply Chain Due Diligence Processes
•
•

•
•

We expect our supply chain to have suitable anti-slavery and human trafficking policies and
processes, in line with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
We have adopted a strict and stringent pre-qualification system, by way of Achilles Building
Confidence and Constructionline, which are industry-specific, audited processes. This is deemed to
be market leading for all of our key trade contractors. All Constructionline members must have an
SSIP (Safety Schemes in Procurement) membership in order to be considered for approved status.
Supply-chain members are reviewed annually, as part of their ongoing membership of
Constructionline or Achilles Building Confidence. Any organisation in the supply chain that fails to
maintain the required membership status will be removed from the McLaren approved supplier list.
We expect each entity in the supply chain to carry out due diligence on the next link in the chain, taking
ownership for this to ensure compliance. It is not practical for McLaren (and every other participant in
the chain) to have a direct relationship with all links in the supply chain.

United Arab Emirates Supply Chain Due Diligence Processes
•

McLaren Construction Ltd’s UAE operations are acutely aware of the need for attention to the origin,
sourcing and recruitment of the workforce and the need to ensure that appropriate due diligence
measures and monitors are applied to limit exposure to exploitation (including slavery and human
trafficking) of both the directly employed workforce and the supply chain.

•

Our UAE operation, in employing and mobilising its own direct workforce, has recognised the need to
avoid intolerable recruitment practices and, in pursuit of this, has deployed an approved, registered
sourcing partner that is committed to dealing directly with the workforce and not through any subagents or partners, again limiting the possibility of exposure to exploitation. Coupled with this partner,
it has, in strict compliance with relevant employment legislation and stringent overseas foreign
ministries rules, engendered robust procedures in selection, appointment and reimbursement of the
workforce, paying keen attention to key exploitation deterrents, such as ensuring that payments and
benefits given to workers are commensurate with their employment contracts and paid directly to the
employees themselves.

•

With regards to procurement of the supply chain in the UAE, we are equally intolerant of slavery and
human trafficking practices and therefore carefully select our business partners on the basis that they,
similarly, strictly comply with applicable legislation.

American Express Group Services Limited (together “American Express’”) in accordance with Section
54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”).
This statement sets out American Express' actions to understand all potential modern slavery risks
related to its business and to put in place steps that are aimed at ensuring that there is no slavery or
human trafficking in its business and supply chains. American Express recognises that it has a
responsibility to take a robust approach to slavery and human trafficking and is absolutely committed
to preventing slavery and human trafficking in its corporate activities, and to ensuring that its supply
chains are free from slavery and human trafficking.
Our business
American Express is a global services company. Our principal products and services include charge
and credit payment cards and travel-related services, offered to consumers and businesses around the
world. Today, American Express is present in more than 130 countries, including all E.U. countries.
In the UK, American Express’ proprietary issuing activities are carried out by American Express
Services Europe Limited, while its proprietary merchant acquiring and servicing activities are carried
out by American Express Payment Services Limited. Both of these American Express subsidiaries are
incorporated in the UK and regulated as payment institutions by the FCA. In addition, American Express
Europe LLC, a Delaware-incorporated limited liability corporation, with a branch in the UK, operates as
a multicurrency clearing house for American Express internationally while also providing consumer
travel services. American Express Group Services Limited is a UK-incorporated company which
provides intra-group services. American Express is committed to the highest ethical standards within
both its business and supply chain and expects the same standards from its suppliers.
Our people
American Express carries out compliance checks on all new employees to ensure that they have the
right to work in the United Kingdom. In addition, American Express requires that suppliers of contract
or temporary resourcing carry out their own checks of individuals’ right s to work in the UK.
Supply Chain
Global Supply Management (GSM) is responsible for governance of the Company’s third-party
management program. This includes, but is not limited to, facilitating the efficient and effective use of
company resources in the acquisition of goods and services from third-party suppliers, while protecting
the American Express brand and other financial assets, and complying with company policy and
regulatory requirements. The GSM organisation comprises various procurement spend categories,
including: (a) Marketing, Advertising and Print; (b) Customer Servicing; (c) Financial, Infrastructure, and
Professional Services; and (d) Technology. GSM’s category teams enable the achievement of business
goals by strategically identifying and executing spend optimisation opportunities and by coordinating
global and local procurement strategies across the Americ an Express supply chain.
Additionally, the GSM organisation includes the third-party lifecycle management (TLM) Centre of
Expertise. TLM are responsible for performing risk assessments, collecting and reviewing the
sufficiency of due diligence required from suppliers, selective validation of ongoing oversight
documentation and reporting on third-party risk.

Policies and Due Diligence
As a payment services provider, although we have evaluated the risk of slavery and human trafficking
from occurring within our supply chain as low, as part of our ongoing commitment to the highest ethical
standards we leverage the following as ways in which American Express can further mitigate any risk:


All employees at American Express are required to complete Code of Conduct training on an annual
basis. Failure to do so constitutes a disciplinary offence. The Code of Conduct sets the highest
ethical standards and requires employees to report any suspicion of non-compliant and/or unethical
behaviour (which would include breaches of the Act) either by American Express or any of its
business partners, including but not limited to suppliers.



All employees at American Express are required to follow the organisation’s values, which are the
principles which guide how we carry out our business and interact with our people and communities.
We aim to deliver exceptional service to our customers by building long-lasting relationships based
on trust and understanding, and the same approach applies to our relationships with suppliers.
Further, employees - working in partnership with GSM - interact with suppliers, managing risks,
analysing data and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. Our employees work together
across business lines and communicate effectively to ensure all supplier engagement activities are
conducted with integrity.



When GSM contracts with a supplier it stipulates inter alia that: (1) suppliers must comply with all
applicable laws when providing goods and/ or services to American Express; (2) appropriate
background checks must be carried out on all supplier personnel; and (3) sub-contracting is
generally prohibited without the express consent of American Express.



GSM has developed a comprehensive Approved Supplier List (ASL) and where possible seeks to
use ASL suppliers instead of new suppliers. ASL status means at a minimum that there is a valid
contract in place with a supplier and that they have been the subject of a risk assessment process
which includes, where applicable, verification that the supplier has in place an adequate Code of
Conduct, background check and compliance policies as well as all required business licenses.
Through the ASL we can minimise the risk of unethical practices (including slavery and human
trafficking) from being introduced into the supply chain.



The TLM programme is a comprehensive and rigorous approach to managing third-party
relationships throughout their entire lifecycle. The programme ensures that we appropriately
oversee our third party relationships, and comply with strict regulatory requirements in relation to
governance, oversight and documentation. The risk assessment model covers several risk
categories ranging from strategic risk to reputational risk and operational risk.



The Anti-Corruption Due Diligence programme is designed to prevent the misuse of American
Express funds to further corruption; to protect American Express and its employees from criminal
and civil liability by prohibiting activities that violate applicable laws; and to prevent employees and
third parties from engaging in bribery on American Express’ behalf.

About

Modern slavery statement
Modern slavery is an abhorrent abuse of human rights, and includes practices such as
forced labour, debt bondage, human trafficking and child labour.
VSO has a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goal
8.7, is committed to ensuring that there are no instances of modern slavery or human trafficking occurring
within our global organisation or our supply chains.
VSO is committed to the ethical treatment of suppliers and partners and is in adherence with the International
Labour Organisation (ILO) Standards, the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) and the UN Global Compact.
VSO recognises that focusing on tackling modern slavery not only protects vulnerable workers, but also helps
to prevent and remedy severe human rights violations.
VSO is focused on ethical and responsible business practice in our global supply chains and will continue to
learn, review and adapt our processes to ensure best practice.
In keeping with VSO’s vision of a fair world for everyone, wherever possible we source goods and services
locally in the countries we operate. Our supplier base is broad and diverse and is comprised of organisations
best able to meet our requirements. If an existing supplier were to be suspected of having links to involvement
in modern slavery, interaction with that supplier would immediately cease.
VSO operates several policies that assist in the prevention of slavery and human trafficking in our operations:
Whistleblowing Policy: VSO encourages all its employees, workers, agency workers, volunteers, partner organisations,
donors, suppliers and other business partners to report any concerns related to our direct activities and our supply chains
without fear of retaliation.
Global Code of Conduct: VSO strives to maintain the highest standards of conduct and ethical behaviour when operating
abroad and managing its supply chain. All VSO employees and volunteers must abide by the Global Code of Conduct.
Global People Resourcing Policy: background and suitability checks are conducted for all VSO staff prior to commencing
work. As part of VSO’s onboarding process, all staff are required to provide proof of their identity and their right to work in
the country in which they are hired.
Global Procurement Policy: requires all staff and volunteers, regardless of their role and for all procurement whatever the
value, to follow the procurement principles of fairness, transparency, ethical behaviour, compliance and value for money.
The Policy also states ‘Procurement activity must not support organisations involved in criminal activity such as fraud,
corruption, forced labour (modern slavery) and other human rights abuses.’ The Procurement Policy demands that
whoever is involved in procurement must also refer and adhere to our other relevant Core Policies.

VSO expects suppliers to be ethical in the treatment of their workers and suppliers: working conditions and
relationships should not involve abuse or exploitation, workers and suppliers should be paid fair wages, and
on time. Before contracts are awarded, due diligence checks are done on suppliers. Due diligence is carried
out at country office level and includes, but is not limited to, numerous sanctions list checks (which contains
names of individuals or organisations who are known to be involved in financing crime or terrorism), reference
checks and site visits where appropriate.
VSO staff are reminded that they must be vigilant and aware of the possibility of human rights abuses such as
modern slavery taking place in suppliers’ businesses and supply chains. Any concerns regarding suspected
modern slavery practices are required to be reported internally.
When making purchasing choices, VSO strives to purchase from organisations which have similar visions and
values to its own. Gender equality and inclusion are cross-cutting for all VSO’s programmes and suppliers that
promote these values (e.g. women-owned enterprises, organisations providing employment opportunities to
marginalised groups such as individuals with disabilities) are invited to bid where possible.
VSO is an accredited Living Wage employer, which means that VSO staff and suppliers who provide services
to VSO are paid a living wage in the UK.
Training to heighten awareness of modern slavery and how to report it is incorporated into our criminal
practices awareness training, which is mandatory for all VSO people as part of their induction.

About this statement
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes VSO’s
slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020. It was approved
by the Board on 22 October 2020.
The statement is reviewed annually by the Board.

Our Policy
ECO Animal Health Group Plc (ECO) is opposed to slavery and human trafficking in any part
of our business or our supply chain. We are therefore committed to ensuring that we have
suitable procedures and actions in place to identify and prevent these practices.

Our Business
ECO develops, registers and markets pharmaceutical products for global animal health
markets. ECO is a public company trading on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange
and is headquartered in the UK employing over 200 people across 14 global offices. We are
a semi-virtual company making extensive use of contract research organisations and third
party manufactures to conduct our research and produce our products. We sell in over 70
countries via subsidiaries, joint ventures, or 3rd party distributors.

Our Supply Chains
All of ECO’s supply chains operate within the heavily regulated pharmaceutical sector and
must comply with the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and Good Distribution Practice
(GDP) requirements to ensure that our products are consistently produced, controlled and
shipped according to quality standards. National regulators undertake regular inspections
and ECO conducts its own audits of our suppliers and third party manufactures to ensure
continued GMP compliance.
As part of our compliance with our slavery and human trafficking policy, in addition to the
previously reported actions, we have taken the following further steps:
•

•

•

•

We have trained a further number of key ECO staff who undertake audits of our
suppliers, contract research organisations and contract manufacturers to be able to
identify potential risk areas and alert the Global Operations Director to any concerns.
We have met with the head of our largest supplier in China to explain the ECO Policy
on slavery and human trafficking and gain his assurance of compliance within his
organisation.
We have met with the head of our JV in China to explain the ECO Policy on slavery
and human trafficking, to check his understanding and gain his assurance of
compliance within the JV.
We have undertaken a number of supplier site visits during the year in China, USA,
Ireland and UK and no evidence of modern day slavery practices were identified.

Our Relevant Policies
Our policy on slavery and human trafficking is set out at the commencement of this
statement.

In keeping with ECO’s commitment to act with integrity in all its business dealings, many of
our existing policies are relevant to ensure that there is no slavery or human trafficking in
any part of the business.
Our relevant policies include:
•
•
•
•
•

Equal Opportunities , Dignity at Work Policy and Positive Work Environment Policy
""Whistleblowing"" Policy and Associated Procedures
Grievance Procedure
Avoidance of Bribery and Corruption Policy
Policy for dealing with allegations of Sexual Harassment or Bullying in or related to the
workplace

Training
Training is being undertaken to ensure our staff have an understanding of the risks of
modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chains, how they can
identify if it is taking place and what actions they should take. During the year:
•

•
•

•

A second Modern Slavery training day (CPD accredited) was delivered by our third
party training consultant, Peel Solutions Ltd, to a wider group of 7 staff from Sales,
Quality, Regulatory, R&D and North American Manufacture. These staff visit our
global suppliers, contract research and contract manufacturing facilities
We were joined on the training day by one of our Non-executive main Board
Directors who found the experience very informative and most useful.
We have developed and delivered an in-house training session on Modern Day
slavery to our teams in ECO Japan and ECO Shanghai to increase their awareness and
to enable them to identify and act on any suspicions when they visit suppliers.
We have identified a Modern Slavery training course being run in Shanghai in
Mandarin for our ECO Shanghai General Manager as she regularly conducts GMP &
Quality audits of our suppliers in China.

Monitoring
ECO has established initial key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess the effectiveness of
our procedures and activities to ensure that modern day slavery and human trafficking is
not taking place in any part of our business or supply chains.

Board Approval
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and
constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending
31st March 2018.

MODERN SLAVERY STATEMENT FOR FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2019
ISSUED PURSUANT TO SECTION 54 OF THE MODERN SLAVERY ACT
2015
VictoriaPlum.com is an online specialist bathroom retailer, based in Doncaster and employing c. 390 staff that are
now working from home or in our premises that handle our warehousing and regional distribution. We do not operate
any other business outside of this environment and we sell our products to just the UK market.
We have a supply chain which sources bathroom related product from the UK, Europe and the Far East. Our
supplier base encompasses approximately 110 supply partners.
As part of the UK’s retail sector we have long been committed to protecting and improving the rights, working
conditions and well-being of the people who work for us directly and indirectly through our supply chain. We
recognise modern forms of slavery can be very difficult to detect and we must therefore be diligent in our approach
to understanding where the potential risks could be present.
In line with our own values, policies and processes, we operate a zero-tolerance approach to slavery and remain
committed to tackling this type of human rights abuse through the effective due diligence and risk assessment of our
supply chains.

OUR POLICIES
We are absolutely committed to ensuring our supply chain is free from slavery and human trafficking and that our
partners manage in a way that is compliant to all applicable human rights, employment and environmental
requirements, both on a local and national basis.
We utilise the following policies through our supply chain (delivered via a Vendor Compliance Document)

Supplier Code of Conduct
Responsible Sourcing Policy
Environmental Policy
Health and Safety Policy
We have a number of internal policies to ensure we conduct business in an ethical and transparent manner. We
operate robust recruitment policies, including conducting eligibility to work in the UK checks for all employees to
safeguard against human trafficking or individuals being forced to work against their will. These requirements extend
to 3rd party providers. Our internal policies include, but are not limited to:

Employee Code of Conduct
Whistleblowing Policy
Recruitment and Agency workers policy
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy
Health and Safety Policy
These policies clearly outline the expectation and potential outcomes of intervention should a policy be breached.
Any reporting will be fully investigated, and appropriate remedial actions taken. This may include notifying statutory
or legal entities as appropriate.

DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES

We enjoy well-established and stable working relationships with our key suppliers in all our sourcing territories and
we have achieved full support to our approach. All goods are manufactured in modern purpose-built factories with
up to date approaches to corporate, social and environmental matters.
We conduct regular supplier audits to ensure alignment to local laws, standards set out by the International Labour
Organisation, the Modern Slavery Act and our internal policies and standards, which include:

Clear obligations on suppliers to comply and implement controls to prevent Modern Slavery;
Ensuring all employment shall be voluntary;
Provision of an employment contract confirming the employee's right to leave work and the ability to
terminate employment upon expiry of reasonable notice.
We may terminate a contract at any time should any instances of modern slavery come to light.
We monitor and review data published in slavery advisor resources to identify potential or increased slavery risks
presented by any new region where we may look to source from. We can then tailor our audit process to increase
the interrogation level around employment, slavery and general working practices.
An example of such a resource is https://www.globalslaveryindex.org.

TRAINING AND EFFECTIVENESS OF VICTORIAPLUM.COM ANTI SLAVERY MEASURES
Training has been completed by all employees in our buying department to ensure a high level of awareness and
understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain.
We do recognise the need to continually develop additional tools to effectively engage our suppliers, particularly
those in high risk countries. As this development progresses and matures we will build key performance measures to
help track the effectiveness of our audit processes. We will also monitor and learn from industry best practices as
they develop and consult with external stakeholders as appropriate to help strengthen our efforts.
Everyone within the business is encouraged to report any concerns regarding slavery and /or human trafficking in
accordance with our whistleblowing policy.
This statement is made pursuant to section 54 (1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our anti-slavery
and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending February 2019. It sets out the steps taken, and those
which Victoria Plum Limited intends to take in the future to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in our
supply chains or in any part of our business.
The statement has been approved by our Board of Directors who will review and update it on an annual basis.

and Human Trafficking
Statement (2017)
Introduction
As the leading employee engagement technology provider, Reward Gateway understands the importance

of removing slavery and human trafficking from our global society – we live by our Think Global value

inside and outside of our business. We’ve all got a responsibility to be alert to the risks and everyone at

Reward Gateway is expected to report concerns through the appropriate channels, with management

acting upon them quickly and efficiently.

Our structure and background
We provide SaaS products to HR in order for companies to attract, engage, and retain employees.

Founded in London, UK, in 2006, we have subsequently opened offices in Birmingham, Sydney,

Melbourne, Plovdiv, Skopje, and Boston in the USA.

Our supply chain
Whilst we resource our core services including engineering in-house where we have full control, like most

large businesses we have a large supply chain, especially in the fulfillment part of our benefits and rewards

products. Whilst almost all of our direct suppliers are in countries where the risk of slavery and human

trafficking is low, we are conscious that the 3,000 retailers that we work with globally have their own

complex supply chains that are in higher risk areas. We vet retailers where we can to ensure they meet our

own high standards and we actively monitor industry and consumer news to be alert to issues that arise

and we act quickly, removing any supply chain partner where we have reasonable belief that they do not

meet our standards.

Our colleagues
Reward Gateway operates a rigorous recruitment selection process for all hiring decisions which includes

obtaining documented proof of the individual’s right to work in the country in which they will be employed.

We will always pay colleagues at least the minimum wage rate applicable in the geography in which they

work.

We are passionate about doing business the right way, and all of our colleagues are required to

demonstrate the highest ethics. All colleagues are guided by the eight values which we share. These

shape how we think, plan and make decisions to deliver operational excellence and best serve our

customers.

Our stance towards slavery and human
trafficking
Given the nature of our business, we believe the risk of modern slavery in our supply chain is low

compared to businesses operating in other sectors. However, we do not intend to be complacent and will

continue to work to improve our policies and procedures to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not

taking place anywhere in our supply chains.

We have zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking. We expect all those in our supply chain and

contractors to comply with our values.

How we ensure our stance

Speak Up – The organisation encourages all its workers, customers and other business partners to report

any concerns related to the direct activities, or the supply chains of the organisation. This includes any

circumstances that may give rise to an enhanced risk of slavery or human trafficking. The organisation's

process is designed to make it easy for workers to make disclosures, without fear of retaliation. Those who

have concerns can raise concerns via their line manager or by emailing infosec@rewardgateway.com

Staff Handbook – The organisation's handbook makes clear to employees the actions and behaviour

expected of them when representing the organisation. The organisation strives to maintain the highest

standards of employee conduct and ethical behaviour when operating abroad and managing its supply

chain.

Procurement – The organisation is committed to ensuring that its retail partners adhere to the highest

standards of ethics and only partners with reputable companies to ensure this.

Agency workers policy – The organisation uses only specified, reputable employment agencies to source

labour and always verifies the practices of any new agency it is using before accepting workers from that

agency.

Assessment of effectiveness in
preventing Modern Slavery
We understand that Modern Slavery risk is not static, and will continue our leading approach to mitigating

this risk in the year ahead.

This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes the

Reward Gateway’s slavery and human trafficking statement for this financial year.

Origin UK Operations Limited (trading as Origin Fertilisers and PB Kent) is committed to
conducting itself with the highest ethical and legal standards. We ensure that the operations
within the business and its supply chain meet those standards at all times and are compliant
with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
We are aware that Human trafﬁckers and illegal / unlicensed gang-masters target a range of
industries including those involved in the Agricultural sector. It remains important therefore that
we maintain our vigilance and continually improve our controls and procedures.

Our MSA processes, controls and measures
We recognise that continuous improvement is important and we closely monitor UK
government guidance, updates and requirements. During the period since our last statement
and despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Origin UK Operations Limited has put in place a number
of actions, including the following:
Implemented new e-learning training on Modern Slavery for all employees of Origin UK
Operations to improve general awareness and understanding of the risks.
Implemented a new supplier compliance check process requiring new and existing
suppliers to read and accept our stance in relation to preventing Modern Slavery.
Development of a new internal Modern Slavery Policy, outlining our response to the MSA
Act of 2015, including detail of current procedures that we have in place.
We have created an MSA Steering group, comprising of senior HR, Operations and
Finance representatives to meet on a regular basis to implement and develop MSA
controls and procedures.

The pandemic
We are acutely aware that the COVID-19 pandemic brought increased risk to Modern Slavery
in some industries and some organisations within the Agricultural sector. We understand that
the situation changes frequently and the effect of consumers stockpiling certain goods and the
general impact on the food sector supply chain, which needs to be increasingly agile,
adapting to unforeseen shocks. This suggests that changes may be needed, to make the
supply chain in the food sector more resilient (source: UK Parliament). Whilst we continue to
monitor indications affecting our industry, we can conﬁrm that to date:
Origin UK Operation’s own recruitment and stafﬁng demand has been stable throughout
the pandemic.
Origin UK Operations fully supported its own employees with COVID-19 support, being
more ﬂexible regarding working hours, working practices, working from home and offering
wellbeing advice. All sites were fully risk-assessed as required with regular brieﬁngs to all
employees on covid controls and measures in place, with the provision of PPE to ensure
all workplaces are covid-19 secure.
There have been no indications or evidence to suggest that our supply chain has suffered
from an increased risk of Modern Slavery.
Payment of suppliers has not suffered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic with our
usual supplier invoices being paid on time and in full.

Other existing procedures
Origin UK Operations also gives an opportunity for all employees to identify risks
anonymously through its Whistleblowing process, which is detailed on notice boards on all
sites and on the shared network drive. New starters also receive relevant information upon
joining the Company within their new starter pack, to raise awareness of modern slavery,
human trafﬁcking and the whistleblowing procedure.
We continue our internal ‘risk checks’ to ensure that any permanent or seasonal
employment (within our 240 workforce, based at various sites within the UK) does not
contravene our own ethical standards or any legislation or government guidance.
We will promptly answer questions posed by our customers in respect of the Modern
Slavery Act who wish to know more about our operations and / or our supply chain.

Our supply chain
We are a manufacturer and distributor and our supply chain is global in its reach. We source
from manufacturers directly or through intermediaries. Many of our suppliers are large in scale
with deemed low-risk of non-compliance to the Modern Slavery Act, however, as a Company

we remain vigilant to all risks, particularly in small-scale businesses in whose sector there may
sometimes be a higher risk of unlicensed manual, seasonal labour.
Origin UK Operations Limited is committed to ensuring our supply chain is free from human
rights abuses. We actively welcome comments and suggestions from anyone within our supply
chain about how we can improve our operations or further reduce any risks in our supply
chain. If you have any questions regarding this issue please contact us by emailing us
