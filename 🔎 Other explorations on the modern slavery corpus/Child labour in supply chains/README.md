# Case study: check what are companies already doing to address child labour in supply chains.

## For data scientists, students or professionals, access the datasets from the UK and Australia and search if the companies mention child labor/labour in their statements. 
 ### Proposed questions: 
 - Do the companies move beyond mentioning child labour as part of the definition of modern slavery?
 - Do they present clear steps to address child labour as a subset of modern slavery? If so, what are those? 
 - How many companies identified and reported on any risks of incidents of child labour in the statement? What are the trends observed?


 ### Proposed steps 
1. Acess the UK statements from [Archive of BHRRC The Modern Slavery Registry](https://github.com/the-future-society/Project-AIMS-AI-against-Modern-Slavery/tree/main/%F0%9F%97%84%EF%B8%8F%20Data%20and%20text%20extraction/Archive%20of%20BHRRC%20The%20Modern%20Slavery%20Registry), [GOV.UK Modern slavery statement registry](https://github.com/the-future-society/Project-AIMS-AI-against-Modern-Slavery/tree/main/%F0%9F%97%84%EF%B8%8F%20Data%20and%20text%20extraction/%F0%9F%87%AC%F0%9F%87%A7%20GOV.UK%20Modern%20slavery%20statement%20registry) and [the Australian Modern Slavery Statements Register](https://modernslaveryregister.gov.au/).
2. Set up a Google Colab notebook (you can also run this locally)
3. In your Google Colab notebook or .jpynb, provide answers to the following:  
   - What methodology do you propose to ansewer the questions? 
   - Present the code of the solutions developed and interpret your results.  Ensure that each section of the solution is well described and documented.  
   - How do you assess the quality of your results? What are the challenges? What would  you recommend to do to improve your initial results? 
4. Share the link of your Google Colab notebook or your .jpynb with  [Adriana](mailto:adriana.bora@thefuturesociety.org) or present it during our next meeting. 

## For policymakers, legislators and analysts:
 ### Proposed questions: 
- What metrics should be designed to benchmark and measure the companiesâ€™ response to The Dutch Child Labour Due Diligence Law?
- How can the existing larger modern slavery legislations should be redesigned to ensure that particular attention is paid to child labour and the urgency to eradicate it by 2025?
- In your view, how can technology assist in the fight against child labour?

Share your answers with [Adriana](mailto:adriana.bora@thefuturesociety.org) or present them during our next meeting.
