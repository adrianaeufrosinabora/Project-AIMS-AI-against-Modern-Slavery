For data scientists, students or professionals, join Project AIMS GitHub community and check what are companies already doing to address child labour in supply chains. 

Proposed steps: 
o	Access the datasets from the UK and Australia 
o	Search if the companies mention child labor/labour in their statements. Possible questions to be answered:
	Do the companies move beyond mentioning child labour as part of the definition of modern slavery?
	Do they present clear steps to address child labour as a subset of modern slavery? If so, what are those?
	How many companies identified and reported on any risks of incidents of child labour in the statement? What are the trends observed?
For policymakers, legislators and analysts:
-	What metrics should be designed to benchmark and measure the companies’ response to The Dutch Child Labour Due Diligence Law?
-	How can the existing larger modern slavery legislations should be redesigned to ensure that particular attention is paid to child labour and the urgency to eradicate it by 2025?
-	In your view, how can technology assist in the fight against child labour?
