# Case study: check what are companies already doing to address child labour in supply chains.

##For data scientists, students or professionals,
 ### Proposed steps:
  Access the datasets from the UK and Australia
Search if the companies mention child labor/labour in their statements. Possible questions to be answered:
 Do the companies move beyond mentioning child labour as part of the definition of modern slavery?
Do they present clear steps to address child labour as a subset of modern slavery? If so, what are those?
How many companies identified and reported on any risks of incidents of child labour in the statement? What are the trends observed?
### For policymakers, legislators and analysts:
What metrics should be designed to benchmark and measure the companiesâ€™ response to The Dutch Child Labour Due Diligence Law?
How can the existing larger modern slavery legislations should be redesigned to ensure that particular attention is paid to child labour and the urgency to eradicate it by 2025?
In your view, how can technology assist in the fight against child labour?
Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions.

Alice - if you like this idea, I can make a new subproject on the GitHub and link it here. Here is an example: https://github.com/the-future-society/Project-AIMS-AI-against-Modern-Slavery/tree/main/%F0%9F%93%94%20Model%20for%20multi-class%20and%20multi-label%20classification%20for%20core%20metrics/Sub-project%20Multi-label%20classification%20for%20the%20Incidents%20Remediation%20Metric [AB1]
so this would be a call for interested researchers to participate? I love this idea! How would this appear in the article? [ec2] [ec2]
